#### Metadata

These files are generated from the IRS schemas by a different repo--[see here](https://github.com/jsfenfen/irs990_admin).

While that repo uses an automatic process to extract values, the IRS has stopped providing the schema files for new versions. It's also possible to human edit the metadata files here (carefully!) to keep up with new versions etc.
