A simple, SQL-ish language for DynamoDB

Getting Started
===============
The easiest way to use DQL is to download and run the install script::

    curl -o install.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevearc/dql/master/bin/install.py
    python install.py

This will create a standalone ``dql`` file that you can run. If you would
instead like to install it with pip::

    pip install dql

Here are some basic DQL examples to get you going:

Start the REPL::

    $ dql
    us-west-1>

Creating a table::

    us-west-1> CREATE TABLE forum_threads (name STRING HASH KEY,
             >                             subject STRING RANGE KEY,
             >                             THROUGHPUT (4, 2));

Inserting data::

    us-west-1> INSERT INTO forum_threads (name, subject, views, replies)
             > VALUES ('Self Defense', 'Defense from Banana', 67, 4),
             > ('Self Defense', 'Defense from Strawberry', 10, 0),
             > ('Cheese Shop', 'Anyone seen the camembert?', 16, 1);

Queries::

    us-west-1> SCAN * FROM forum_threads;
    us-west-1> SELECT count(*) FROM forum_threads WHERE name = 'Self Defense';
    us-west-1> SELECT * FROM forum_threads WHERE name = 'Self Defense';

Mutations::

    us-west-1> UPDATE forum_threads ADD views 1 WHERE
             > name = 'Self Defense' AND subject = 'Defense from Banana';
    us-west-1> DELETE FROM forum_threads WHERE name = 'Cheese Shop';

Changing tables::

    us-west-1> ALTER TABLE forum_threads SET THROUGHPUT (8, 4);
    us-west-1> DROP TABLE forum_threads;

And don't forget to use ``help``!
