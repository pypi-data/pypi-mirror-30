class ActorConfig(object):

    '''
    A configuration object pass to a Wishbone actor.

    This is a simple object which holds a set of attributes (with some sane
    defaults) a Wishbone Actor expects.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name identifying the actor instance.
        size (int): The size of the Actor instance's queues.
        frequency (int): The time in seconds to generate metrics.
        template_functions (dict): A dictionary of template functions.
        description (str): A short free form discription of the actor instance.
        module_functions (dict): A dict of queue names containing an array of module_functions
        protocol (``func``, ``wishbone.protocol.Encode``): A function returning a ``decoder.handler()``
                                                           method or a protocol encode instance.
        io_event (bool): When ``True`` Input and Output modules know to expect or emit serialzed wishbone events.
        identification (str): A name assigned to the Wishbone instance, useful for the module to know such as logging.
        disable_exception_handling (bool): If True, exception handling is disabled. Usefull for testing
