    The payload can be just about anything including template functions.


    Parameters::

        - native_events(bool)(False)
           |  Whether to expect incoming events to be native Wishbone events

        - interval(float)(1)
           |  The interval in seconds between each generated event.
           |  A value of 0 means as fast as possible.

        - payload(str/dict/int/float)("test")
           |  The content of the test message.

        - destination(str)("data")
