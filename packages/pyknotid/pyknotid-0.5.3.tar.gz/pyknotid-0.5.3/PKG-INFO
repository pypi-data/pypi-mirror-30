Description: 
        Pyknotid
        ========
        
        Python (and optional Cython) modules for detecting and measuring
        knotting and linking. pyknotid can analyse space-curves, i.e. sets of
        points in three-dimensions, or can parse standard topological
        representations of knot diagrams.
        
        A graphical interface to some of these tools is available online at
        `Knot ID <http://inclem.net/knotidentifier>`__.
        
        pyknotid was developed as part of the Leverhulme Trust Research
        Programme Grant RP2013-K-009: Scientific Properties of Complex Knots
        (SPOCK), a collaboration between the University of Bristol and Durham
        University in the UK. For more information, see the `SPOCK homepage
        <http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/spock/index.html/>`__.
