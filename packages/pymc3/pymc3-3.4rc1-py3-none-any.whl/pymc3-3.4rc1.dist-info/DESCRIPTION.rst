Bayesian estimation, particularly using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), is an increasingly relevant approach to statistical estimation. However, few statistical software packages implement MCMC samplers, and they are non-trivial to code by hand. ``pymc3`` is a python package that implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a python class, and is extremely flexible and applicable to a large suite of problems. ``pymc3`` includes methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and convergence diagnostics.
