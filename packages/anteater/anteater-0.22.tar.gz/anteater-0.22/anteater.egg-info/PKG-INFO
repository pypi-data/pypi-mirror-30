      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

Description: # Anteater - CI/CD Gate Check Framework
        
        ![anteater](http://i.imgur.com/BPvV3Gz.png)
        
        [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/anteater/badge/?version=latest)](http://anteater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        Anteater is an open framework that uses standard regular expression that we all
        know (and love?) to ensure unwanted strings, filenames, binaries, depreciated
        functions or staging enviroment code / credentials etc, are not included in any
        patch or pull request to any of your git repositories.
        
        You tell anteater exactly what you don't want to get merged, and anteater looks
        after the rest.
        
        If anteater finds something, it exits with a non-zero code which in turn fails
        the build of your CI tool. Any false positives are easily negated by using the
        same RegExp framework to cancel out the false match.
        
        With a few simple steps it can be easily implemented into a CI / CD workflow
        with tooling such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Gitlab CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/).
        
        It is currently used in the Linux Foundations project ['OPNFV'](https://opnfv.org)
        as means to provide automated security checks at gate, but as shown in the
        examples below, it can be used for other scenarios.
        
        Anteater also provides a Virus Total API, so any binaries, public IP addresses
        or URL's found by anteater, will be sent to the Virus Total API and a report
        will be returned. If any object is reported as malicous, it will fail the build.
        
        Why would I want to use this?
        -----------------------------
        
        Anteater has many uses, and can easily be bent to cover your own specific needs.
        
        First, as mentioned, it can be set up to block strings and files with a
        potential security impact or risk. This could include private keys, a shell
        history, aws credentials etc.
        
        It is especially useful at ensuring that elements used in a staging /
        development enviroment don't find there way into a production enviroment.
        
        Let's take a look at some examples:
        
        ```
        apprun:
          regex: app\.run\s*\(.*debug.*=.*True.*\)
          desc: "Running flask in debug mode could potentially leak sensitive data"
        ```
        
        The above will match code where a flask server is set to running in debug mode
        `` app.run(host='0.0.0.0' port=80 debug=true)``, which can be typical to a
        developers enviroment and mistakenly staged into production.
        
        For a rails app, this could be:
        
        ``  regex: \<%=.*debug.*%>``
        
        Even more simple, look for the following in most logging frameworks:
        
        `` regex: log\.debug``
        
        Need to stop developers mistakenly adding a private key?
        
        ```
          private_key:
            regex: -----BEGIN\sRSA\sPRIVATE\sKEY----
            desc: "This looks like it could be a private key"
        ```
        
        How about credential files that would cause a job loss if ever leaked into
        production? Anteater works with file names too.
        
        For Example:
        
        ``jenkins\.plugins\.publish_over_ssh\.BapSshPublisherPlugin\.xml``
        
        Or even..
        
        ```
        - \.pypirc
        - \.gem\/credentials
        - aws_access_key_id
        - aws_secret_access_key
        - LocalSettings\.php
        ```
        
        If your app has its own custom secrets / config file, then its very easy to
        add your own regular expressions. Everything is set using YAML formatting,
        so no need to change anteaters code.
        
        Depreciated functions, classes etc
        ----------------------------------
        
        Another use is for when a project depreciates an old function, yet developers
        might still make pull requests using the old function naming:
        
        ```
        depreciated_function:``
          regex: depreciated_function\(.*\)
          desc: This function was depreciated in release X, use Y function.
        ```
        
        Or perhaps stopping people from using 1.x versions of a framework:
        
        ``<script.src.*="https:\/\/ajax\.googleapis\.com\/ajax\/libs\/angularjs\/1.*<\/script>``
        
        What if I get false postives?
        -----------------------------
        
        Easy, you set a RegExp to stop the match , kind of like RegExp'ception.
        
        Let's say we want to stop use of MD5:
        
        ```
        md245:
          regex: md[245]
          desc: "Insecure hashing algorithm"
        ```
        
        This then incorrectly gets matched to the following:
        
        ``mystring = int(amd500) * 4``
        
        We set a specific ignore RegEx, so it matches and then is unmatched by the
        ignore entry.
        
        ``mystring.=.int\(amd500\).*``
        
        Yet other instance of ``MD5`` continue to get flagged.
        
        Binaries
        --------
        
        With anteater, if you pass the argument ``--binaries``, any binary found
        causes a build failure on the originating pull request. It is not until a
        sha256 checksum is set within anteater's YAML ignore files, that the build is
        allowed to pass.
        
        This means you can block people from checking in compiled objects, images, PDFs
        etc that may have an unknown origin or tampering with the existing binary files.
        
        An example:
        
        ```
        $ anteater --binaries --project myproj --patchset /tmp/patch
        Non Whitelisted Binary file: /folder/to/repo/images/pal.png
        Please submit patch with this hash: 3aeae9c71e82942e2f34341e9185b14b7cca9142d53f8724bb8e9531a73de8b2
        ```
        Let's enter the hash::
        ```
        binaries:
          images/pal.png:
            - 3aeae9c71e82942e2f34341e9185b14b7cca9142d53f8724bb8e9531a73de8b2
        ```
        Run the job again::
        ```
        $ anteater --binaries --project myproj --patchset /tmp/patch
        Found matching file hash for: /folder/to/repo/images/pal.png
        ```
        
        This way we can sure binaries are not tampered with by means of a failed
        cryptographic signature / checksum.
        
        Any binaries not having a sha256 checksum will also be sent to the Virus Total
        API for scanning.
        
        Virus Total API
        ---------------
        
        If the following flags (combined or individually) ``--ips``, ``-urls``, ``--binaries``
        are used, anteater will perform a lookup to the Virus Total API.
        
        IP addresses, will be have their DNS history checked for any previous or present connection
        with known black listed domains marked as malicious or containing malware.
        
        URLs, will be checked for any previous or present connection with known black listed domains
        marked as malicious or containing malware.
        
        As mentioned, Binaries will be sent to Virus Total and verified as clean / infected.
