Simple CLI password generator. Written in Python

Installation: `pip install passgen-cli`
Example: `passgen-cli -l 13`

If you just want to execute passgen.py by itself as a script, you can use passgen.py as a normal script, i.e. as the command line front end to your application. Set permissions via `$ chmod u+x passgen_cli.py` and execute it:
`./passgen_cli.py -l`
