    L1 distance, a.k.a. the Manhattan or Taxi Cab distance.

    The L1 distance is calculated as the sum of absolute differences.
    It's used as a more computationally efficient alternative to the L2
    distance. It is also a suitable alternative to the Cosine distance
    provided that the vectors have been normalized first.

    Hamming distance.

    The Hamming distance is calculated by comparing each component of
    the vectors and counting those which are not equal.
    The components could be single bits or integers.
    In the case of single bit components, the Hamming distance is
    equivalent to performing XOR and counting the number of bits.

    number of bits.

    Jaccard (a.k.a. Tanimoto) similarity.

    The Jaccard similarity metric only applies for 1-bit components.
    It is calculated by dividing the size of the intersection between
    two bit sets by the size of their union.

    For bit-vectors, the size of the intersection is determined by
    performing bitwise AND and counting the number of bits set. The size
    of the union is determined by performing bitwise OR and counting the
    number of bits set.
