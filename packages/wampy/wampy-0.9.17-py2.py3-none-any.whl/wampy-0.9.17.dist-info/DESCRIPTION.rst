    WAMP RPC and Pub/Sub for your Python apps and microservices

Hello world.

This is a Python implementation of `WAMP`_ not requiring `Twisted`_ or asyncio, enabling use within classic blocking Python applications. It is a light-weight alternative to `autobahn`_.

With **wampy** you can quickly and easily create your own **WAMP** clients, whether this is in a web app, a microservice, a script or just in a Python shell.

**wampy** tries to provide an intuitive API for your **WAMP** messaging.

See `ReadTheDocs`_ for more detailed documentation.

wampy features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Remote Procedure Calls over websockets
- Publish and Subscribe over websockets
- Client Authentication
- Transport Layer Security
- CLI for easy and rapid development
- Pytest fixtures to use when testing your projects
- nameko_ integration with nameko_wamp_

QuickStart - Connect and Go!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you've already got access to a running **Router** which has other **Peers** connected, then stay here. If not, jump to the next section. If you're still here...

::

    pip install wampy

...and then open a Python shell.

The example here assumes a **Peer** connected to a **Router** on ``localhost``, port ``8080``, that has registered a remote procedure called ``get_foobar``, and you want to *call* that procedure.

::

    from wampy.peers import Client

    with Client() as client:
        response = client.rpc.get_foobar()

    # do something with the response here

The same example here, but the **Router** is on a *remote* host.

::

    from wampy.peers import Client

    with Client(url="ws://example.com:8080") as client:
        response = client.rpc.get_foobar()

    # do something with the response here

The WAMP Session is "context managed", meaning it begins as you enter, and ends as you exit the scope of the client instance.

See `ReadTheDocs`_ for much more detail on this.

Running and Calling a wampy Application 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before any messaging can happen you need a **Router**. Messages are then routed between **Clients** over an administrative domain on the **Router** called a **Realm**.

For the quickest of starts I suggest that you use **Crossbar.io** and start it up on the default host and port, and with the default **realm** and **roles**. See the `Crossbar.io docs`_ for the instructions on this or alternatively run with **wampy's** testing setup.

::

    $ pip install --editable .[dev]

    $ crossbar start --config ./wampy/testing/configs/crossbar.json

wampy RPC
~~~~~~~~~

Now open your preferred text editor and we'll write a few lines of Python constructing a simple **WAMP** service that takes a decimal number and returns the binary representation of it - wowzers!

::

    from wampy.peers.clients import Client
    from wampy.roles import callee

    class BinaryNumberService(Client):

        @callee
        def get_binary_number(self, number):
            return bin(number)

Save this module somewhere on your Python path and we'll use a **wampy** command line interface tool to start the service.

::

    $ wampy run path.to.your.module.including.module_name:BinaryNumberService

For example, running one of the **wampy** example applications against the Router suggested previously:

::

    $ wampy run docs.examples.services:DateService --config ./wampy/testing/configs/crossbar.json

Actually - no need to panic! The ``BinaryNumberService`` example already exists in the **wampy** examples so put that text editor away if you like. Just execute from the command line:

::

    $ wampy run docs.examples.services:BinaryNumberService --config ./wampy/testing/configs/crossbar.json


Now, open a Python console in a new terminal, allowing the ``BinaryNumberService`` to run uninterupted in your original terminal (but once you're done with it ``Ctrl-C`` is required).

::

    In [1]: from wampy.peers.clients import Client

    In [2]: with Client(url="ws://localhost:8080") as client:
                result = client.rpc.get_binary_number(number=100)

    In [3]: result
    Out[3]: u'0b1100100'

wampy RPC for Crossbar.io
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RPC pattern above was inspired by the nameko_ project, but this pattern may not feel intuitive for those familiar with **Crossbar.io**, the primary Router used by **wampy**.

For this reason there also exists the ``CallProxy`` object which implements the ``call`` API by more loosely wrapping **wampy's** ``Call`` Message. In this pattern, applications and their endpoints are identified by dot delimented strings rather than a single API name, e.g.

::

    "com.example.endpoint"

Just like the ``rpc`` API, the ``call`` API is directly available on every **wampy** client. Lets look at the two examples side by side.

::

    >>> client.rpc.get_foo_bar(eggs, foo=bar, spam=ham)
    >>> client.call("get_foo_bar", eggs, foo=bar, spam=ham)

Noted these are very similar and achieve the same, but the intention here is for the ``call`` API to behave more like a classic **Crossbar.io** application and the ``rpc`` to be used in nameko_wamp_.

The ``call`` API however does allow calls of the form...

::

    >>> client.call("com.myapp.foo.bar", eggs, foo=bar, spam=ham) 

...which you will not be able to do with the ``rpc`` API.


Publishing and Subscribing is equally as simple
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To demonstrate, first of all you need a **Subscriber**. You can either create one yourself in a Python module (as a subclass of a **wampy** ``Client``) or use the example ``Client`` already for you in ``docs.examples.services``.

Here we use the said example service, but all a **Subscriber** is is a **wampy** ``Client`` with a method decorated by ``subscribe``. Take a look and see for yourself in the examples_.

Let's start up that example service.

::

    $ wampy run docs.examples.services:SubscribingService --config ./wampy/testing/configs/crossbar.json

Now we have a service running that subscribes to the topic "foo".

In another terminal, with a **wampy** virtualenv, you can create a **Publisher** - which is no different to any other **wampy** Client.

::

    In [1]: from wampy.peers import Client

    In [2]: with Client() as client:
                result = client.publish(topic="foo", message="spam")

Hopefully you'll see any message you send printed to the screen where the example service is running. You'll also see the meta data that **wampy** chooses to send.

See `ReadTheDocs`_ for more detailed documentation.


Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ pip install --editable .[dev]
    $ py.test ./test -v


Build the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ pip install -r rtd_requirements.txt
    $ sphinx-build -E -b html ./docs/ ./docs/_build/
