        The **matrics.pytest-cov** package is a plugin for the metrics package. 
        
        Basically what this plugin does is it extract the data you get from running 
        "$ coverage report -m" on the command line.
        
        We assume that you run your pytest tests (incl. pytest-cov) before your run
        metrics. In case your test execution fails you should fix your code and rerun the
        tests prior to running metrics with this plugin.
        
        The metrics.pytest-cov plugin picks up the .coverage file from your successful test run. 
        If you must know, we could run the tests but decided not to.
        
        Please note that in case a .coverage file from a testrun is not available we silently do nothing.
