Description: # CTFd Fetch
        
        Often it would be nice to download all the challenges (descriptions/files/etc)
        from a CTF so that you have them for future reference, or to have offline, or to
        share with a team.
        
        That's all this script does.
        
        Since many CTFs have standardized around [CTFd][] as a platform, we use that as
        a starting point.

        ## Caveats
        - **Use this tool considerately**. It makes every attempt to respond sanely, and
          only download things not already downloaded, but make sure you are not abusing
          the good will of a CTF Host/Organizer.
        - This tool primarily uses the JSON response from a CTFd endpoint (`/challs`).
          Any changes to CTFd have the potential to break this tool.
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        Install.
        ```
        pip3 install ctfdfetch
        ```
        
        Download all the challenges from a CTF into the current folder.
        ```
        ctfdfetch --server https://ctf.example.com --user hacker
        ```
        
        For more options such as out directory, nested categories, verbosity, etc).
        ```
        ctfdfetch -h
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        Development occurs on `master`. The `release` branch has the version currently
        pushed to pypi.

        # get code
        git clone https://gitlab.com/royragsdale/ctfdfetch.git
        cd ctfdfetch
