Description: ## SSH metro server
        
        The SSH metro application is an application that allows initiating SSH tunnels dynamically on a remote/server machine and automatically connecting to them.
        
        SSH metro server is the server side application that servers requests from the clients and initiate the required tunnels for the clients to connect on.
        
        ### Technology
        
        SSH metro server uses the following frameworks/libraries for the specified purposes:
        
        * Flask: HTTP server implementation to handle requests from clients
        * Pexpect: To handle operating system level commands to start the SSH tunnels
        
        ### Installation
        
        To install SSH metro server, just run the following command on your server machine:
        
        ```
        $> pip install ssh-metro-server
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```
        $> pipenv install ssh-metro-server
        ```
        
        
        ### Running
        
        To start SSH metro server on your server machine, simply run:
        
        ```
        $> ssh_metro_server
        ```
        
        That command will start SSH metro server on its default port 9871. If you want it to run on an specific port though, just run:
        
        ```
        $> ssh_metro_server -port {PORT}
        ```
        
        That way, SSH metro server will start on the port specified by {PORT} :)
