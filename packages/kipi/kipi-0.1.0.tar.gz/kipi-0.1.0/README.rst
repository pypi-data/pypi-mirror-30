KiPI
====

A tool for downloading and installing kiCad packages, primarily for KiCad v5.

Runs on Windows, should run on Linux (MacOs might also work).

Description
-----------

Currently supports footprints, symbols and templates. Configurations for KiCad
official v5 libraries and templates, SparkFun, DigiKey and Walter Lain libraries.

Where available, point releases are downloaded as a zip file. Otherwise, latest
versions of git repositories are cloned locally.

This script uses git to:

1. Clone a repository if you don't have it
2. Pull the latest repository if you already have it locally (does an update).

Content types:

- Footprints can be installed to fp-lib-table.
- Symbols can be installed to sym-lib-table.
- Templates are copied to $USER/kicad/template
- 3dmodels TODO
- Scripts TODO

Existing xx-lib-table will be saved to xx-lib-table-old.
