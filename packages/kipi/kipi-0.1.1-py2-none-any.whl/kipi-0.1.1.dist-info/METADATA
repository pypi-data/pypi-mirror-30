KiPI
====

A tool for downloading and installing kiCad packages, primarily for KiCad v5.

Runs on Windows, should run on Linux (MacOs might also work).

Description
-----------

Currently supports footprints, symbols and templates. Configurations for KiCad
official v5 libraries and templates, SparkFun, DigiKey and Walter Lain libraries.

Typically where available, point releases are downloaded as a zip file. Otherwise, latest
versions of git repositories can be cloned locally.

This script can use git to:

1. Clone a repository if you don't have it
2. Pull the latest repository if you already have it locally (does an update).

Content types:

- Footprints can be installed to fp-lib-table.
- Symbols can be installed to sym-lib-table.
- Templates are copied to ~/Documents/kicad/templates
- 3dmodels are copied to ${KISYS3DMOD}
- Scripts are copied to ${APPDATA}/kicad/scripting

Existing xx-lib-table will be saved to xx-lib-table-old.

Usage
-----

`kipi [options] <package file> [<version>]`

Package file contains the packages to download/install.
Version is a valid version from the package file or "latest".

Options are:

-h, --help  Shows a help screen on the command line

-v, --verbose  Shows the verbose messages

-q, --quiet  Don't show logging

-c, --config <local folder>  Configure get-libs. The local folder is the folder you want all your local data put in.

-d, --download  Download package data only

-i, --install  Install package data into KiCad (implies download)

-u, --uninstall  Uninstall package data from KiCad


**Example Usage**

`kipi -c c:\\kicad_data`

`kipi -vi kicad-official-libraries-v5.yml`

**Dependencies**

- You need to have git installed to clone/update local git repositories.

Otherwise it should just run with a standard distribution of python 2.x, there
are no special libraries used.

====================  ==========  ==========

Footprints
----------
Footprints are installed in global fp-lib-table.

Symbols
-------
[v5] Symbols are installed in global sym-lib-table.
[v4] Installing symbols is not supported because sym-lib-table is not supported in v4

3dmodels
--------
3dmodels can be installed if KISYS3DMOD is a writable location by user and does
not require admin permissions. On Windows the default path c:\program files\...
is not writable, so the user must re-configure KISYS3DMOD to writable location,
e.g "C:\kicad_data\3dmodels"

Templates
---------
Templates are installed to user's templates folder.

Scripts
-------
Scripts may be pcbnew scripts or footprints wizards.

[v5] Scripts are copied to global kicad/scripting folder.
[v4] May work on Linux but does not work on Windows since v4 does not have a
search path for user scripts.
