KiPI
====

A tool for downloading and installing kiCad packages, primarily for KiCad v5.

Runs on Windows, should run on Linux (MacOs might also work).

Description
-----------

Currently supports footprints, symbols and templates. Configurations for KiCad
official v5 libraries and templates, SparkFun, DigiKey and Walter Lain libraries.

Where available, point releases are downloaded as a zip file. Otherwise, latest
versions of git repositories are cloned locally.

This script uses git to:

1. Clone a repository if you don't have it
2. Pull the latest repository if you already have it locally (does an update).

Content types:

- Footprints can be installed to fp-lib-table.
- Symbols can be installed to sym-lib-table.
- Templates are copied to $USER/kicad/template
- 3dmodels TODO
- Scripts TODO

Existing xx-lib-table will be saved to xx-lib-table-old.

Usage
-----

`kipi [options] <package file> [<version>]`

-v, --verbose  Shows the verbose messages

-q, --quiet  Don't show logging

-c, --config <local folder>  Configure get-libs. The local folder is the folder you want all your local data put in.

-d, --download  Download package data only

-i, --install  Install package data into KiCad (implies download)

-u, --uninstall  Uninstall package data from KiCad
