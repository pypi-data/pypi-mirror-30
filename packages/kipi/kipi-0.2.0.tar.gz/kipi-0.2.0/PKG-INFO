Description: KiPI
        ====
        
        A tool for downloading and installing kiCad packages, primarily for KiCad v5.
        
        Runs on Windows, should run on Linux (MacOs might also work).
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        Currently supports footprints, symbols and templates. Configurations for KiCad
        official v5 libraries and templates, SparkFun, DigiKey and Walter Lain libraries.
        
        Typically where available, point releases are downloaded as a zip file. Otherwise, latest
        versions of git repositories can be cloned locally.
        
        This script can use git to:
        
        1. Clone a repository if you don't have it
        2. Pull the latest repository if you already have it locally (does an update).
        
        Content types:
        
        - Footprints can be installed to fp-lib-table.
        - Symbols can be installed to sym-lib-table.
        - Templates are copied to ~/Documents/kicad/templates
        - 3dmodels are copied to ${KISYS3DMOD}
        - Scripts are copied to ${APPDATA}/kicad/scripting
        
        Existing xx-lib-table will be saved to xx-lib-table-old.

        --config <local folder>  configure kipi. The local folder is the folder you want all your local data put in.
        
        --download  download package data only
        
        --install  install package data into KiCad (implies download)
        
        --list  list installed packages

        ====================  ==========  ==========
        
        Footprint
        ----------
        Footprints are installed in global fp-lib-table.
        
        Symbol
        -------
        - [v5] Symbols are installed in global sym-lib-table.
        - [v4] Installing symbols is not supported because sym-lib-table is not supported in v4
        
        3dmodel
        --------
        3dmodels can be installed if KISYS3DMOD is a writable location by user and does
        not require admin permissions. On Windows the default path c:\\program files\\...
        is not writable, so the user must re-configure KISYS3DMOD to writable location,
        e.g "C:\\kicad_data\\3dmodels"
        
        Template
        ---------
        Templates are installed to user's templates folder.
        
        Script
        -------
        Scripts may be pcbnew scripts or footprints wizards.
        
        - [v5] Scripts are copied to global kicad/scripting folder.
        - [v4] May work on Linux but does not work on Windows since v4 does not have a search path for user scripts.
