# Follow the Money

This repository contains a pragmatic data model for the entities most
commonly used in investigative reporting: people, companies, assets,
payments, court cases, etc.

The purpose of this is not to model reality in an ideal data model, but
rather to have a working data structure for researchers.

`followthemoney` also contains code used to validate and normalize many
of the elements of data, and to map tabular data into the model.
