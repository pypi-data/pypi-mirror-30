Description: console_log
        ===========
        
        This module provides a WSGI middleware that allows you to log to the
        browser console from Python:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import logging
            from flask import Flask
            from console_log import ConsoleLog
        
            console = logging.getLogger('console')
            console.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        
        
            app = Flask(__name__)
        
            @app.route('/')
            def hello():
                console.error('Error logged from Python')
                console.debug('Debug logged from Python')
        
            app = ConsoleLog(app, console)
        
        The logged messages will them show up in the browser console.
