#  Compute in a blink with Google Cloud Platform 

This project was initially inspired by the great project [Compute Engine burst training](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ml-on-gcp/tree/master/gce/burst-training). But instead of relying on the gcloud command line it uses the [google-api-python-client](https://github.com/google/google-api-python-client) python package. Which allows to call the functions directly from python code, or using the shell-script shortcuts. It's all at your convenience.

## Installation
```
pip install git+https://github.com/thooun/pyblink
```

## Usage

Writing in progress... But you can find an example of pyblink-scripts usage in the examples folder.
