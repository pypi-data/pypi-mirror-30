    Handling dhcp port migration
    
    Whenever a DHCP agent dies, the port is attached to a dummy device
    identified by DEVICE_ID_RESERVED_DHCP_PORT. Once the dhcp agent is
    respawned, the port is reattached to the newly created DHCP instance.
    This deletes the old dhcp port from the old host and creates the port
    on the new host. The dhcp port transitions from
    
    (Active <old host, old dhcp, vif:ovs>) to
    (Active <old host, reserved, vif:ovs>) to
    (Down   <new host, new dhcp, vif:unbound>) to
    (Down   <new host, new dhcp, vif:ovs>) to
    (Build  <new host, new dhcp, vif:ovs>) to
    (Active <new host, new dhcp, vif:ovs>)
    
    When the port is updated to
    (Active <old host, reserved, vif:ovs>), the port needs to be removed from
    old host and when the port is updated to (Down <new host, new dhcp, vif:unbound>),
    it should be created on the new host. Removal and creation should take place
    in two updates because when the port is updated to
    (Down <new host, new dhcp, vif:unbound>), the original port would have
    the device id set to 'reserved_dhcp_port' and so it can't be removed
    from CVX at that point.

    Merge "Fail VLAN allocations from outside the assigned range" into stable/mitaka

    Fail VLAN allocations from outside the assigned range
    
    Recently, we stopped failing network_create_postcommit to allow
    networks to be created even when CVX is unavailable. This broke
    the arista vlan type driver functionality in the case of segment
    creates with segmentation_id specified as the base vlan type driver
    adds the segmentation id to the allocation range in this case.
    
    This change checks whether the specified VLAN is in the allocation
    range and fails the call if it isn't and calls the base vlan type
    driver to finish the allocation if it is.

    Clear out ml2_vlan_allocations if CVX has no VLAN pool configured
    
    If there is no vlan pool configured for a region, but CVX was
    reachable, the arista_vlan type driver would fail to start.
    We should treat this case as there being no VLANs assigned
    to the region and clear out all vlan allocations from the db.

    Check that shared networks are VLAN networks before in Arista ML2
    
    When we added support for shared networks, we introduced a bug that
    can result in the arista ML2 driver reacting to a port-create for a
    non-vlan network if the network is a shared network. With this
    change the arista ML2 driver will only react to port creates for
    shared networks if they are vlan networks.

    Use requests library instead of jsonrpclib
    
    This change modifies the Arista ML2 driver to remove the use of jsonrpclib and
    use the requests library instead. An associated change now allows configuring
    the timeout interval for the requests library.
    
    Aditionally, we now attempt to check if the last known EOS master is still
    available before executing an EOS command, allowing the driver to detect a
    switchover and converge faster.

    Fix port creation on shared networks
    
    In create_port_precommit, the VM was only added to the Arista DB if
    the port was associated to a network in the same tenant. But in the
    case of a shared network, the port tenant and the network tenant can
    be different, while the VM should still be added to the DB.
    
    The same goes for removing resources in delete_port_postcommit.
    
    This commit ensures the VM is added to the DB when connected to a
    shared network, and that everything is cleaned-up when disconnected.
