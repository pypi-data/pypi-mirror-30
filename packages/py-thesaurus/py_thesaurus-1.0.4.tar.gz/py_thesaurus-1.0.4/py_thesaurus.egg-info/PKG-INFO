        Description
        """""""""""
        
        This package gets you the thesaurus of an inputted word from the best dictionary sites available online. 
        
        - `Thesaurus.com <http: www.thesaurus.com=""/>`_
        
        - `Dictionary.com <http: www.dictionary.com=""/>`_
        
        Why you need this package?
        """"""""""""""""""""""""""
        
        Though python provides lexical resources like WordNet, the variety it can provide is poor. The rich content the `dictionary.com` or the `thesaurus.com` provides will help the user to enhance their approaches when he/she is dealing with text mining, NLP techniques and much more.
        
        How to install? 
        """""""""""""""
        
        Use basic pip install to install this library.  
        ::
        
          pip install py_thesaurus
        
        Release Notes
        """""""""""""
        
        Version 1.0.4 (2018-04-03)
        --------------------------
        
        - A good samaritan of us named Mr. mpkasa spotted an `UnboundedLocalError` rat.  	
        
        "By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of His anger they come to an end" - Job Chapter 4 Verse 9
        
        Version 1.0.3 (2018-01-13)
        --------------------------
        
        - Solved dependency issue of `lxml`. 
        - Fixed a bug on command line implementation. 
        - Issue tracker link is added in README to report bugs and suggests features.
        
        
        Version 1.0 (2017-12-31)
        ------------------------
        
        - Sometimes you need to disagree in life, we added a feature to get antonyms of an inputted word.
        - Synonyms are not a pile of related words anymore. You want synonyms of ‘love’ as a ‘noun’, you get synonyms of ‘love’ as a ‘noun’. Period.
        - We love everyone being one of a kind, there will not be any duplicates in output lists anymore.
        - Output lists are more refined and ordered by relevance since disciplined is new sexy. 
        - 0.95 is a decimal but 0.9.5 has a meaning in software development. We got it late but happily adapted to Semantic Versioning.
        - Several other bugs are brutally killed during the development of this package. No prayers.
