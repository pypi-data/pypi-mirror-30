Sismic Interactive Statechart Model Interpreter and Checker
-----------------------------------------------------------

Statecharts are a well-known visual language for modeling the executable behavior of complex reactive event-based systems.
The Sismic library for Python >= 3.4 provides a set of tools to define, validate, simulate, execute and debug statecharts.
More specifically, Sismic provides:


- An easy way to define and to import statecharts, based on the human-friendly YAML markup language
- A statechart interpreter offering a discrete, step-by-step, and fully observable simulation engine
- Built-in support for expressing actions and guards using regular Python code, can be easily extended to other programming languages
- A design-by-contract approach for statecharts: contracts can be specified to express invariants, pre- and postconditions on states and transitions
- Runtime checking of behavioral properties expressed as statecharts.
- Predefined step definitions and utilities (including test coverage) to support behavior-driven development
- Synchronous and asynchronous simulation, in real time or simulated time
- Support for communication between statecharts and co-simulation
- Statechart visualization using `PlantUML <http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml>`__

Some experimental features are also available as `feature branches <https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/sismic/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22feature+branch%22>`__.

Installation
------------

Sismic can be installed using ``pip`` as usual: ``pip install sismic``.
This will install the latest stable version.

You can also install Sismic from this repository by cloning it.
The development occurs in the *devel* branch, the latest stable distributed version is in the *master* branch.

Sismic requires Python >=3.4

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for the latest distributed version is available on `sismic.readthedocs.io <http://sismic.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Many examples are available in `docs/examples <https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/sismic/tree/devel/docs/examples>`_.

The documentation can also be directly built from the `docs <https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/sismic/tree/devel/docs>`_ directory using Sphinx.
