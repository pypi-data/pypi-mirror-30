        Sismic Interactive Statechart Model Interpreter and Checker
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        
        *Sismic* is a recursive acronym that stands for *Sismic Interactive Statechart Model Interpreter and Checker*.
        
        Statecharts are a well-known visual modeling language for representing the executable behavior
        of complex reactive event-based systems. Sismic library for Python (version 3.4 or higher) provides a set of
        tools to define, validate, simulate, execute and test statecharts.
        More specifically, Sismic provides:
        
        - An easy way to define and to import statecharts, based on the human-friendly YAML markup language
        - A statechart interpreter offering a discrete, step-by-step, and fully observable simulation engine
        - Built-in support for expressing actions and guards using regular Python code, can be easily extended to other programming languages
        - A design-by-contract approach for statecharts: contracts can be specified to express invariants, pre- and postconditions on states and transitions
        - Runtime checking of behavioral properties expressed as statecharts
        - Built-in support for behavior-driven development
        - Synchronous and asynchronous simulation, in real time or simulated time
        - Support for communication between statecharts and co-simulation
        - Statechart visualization using `PlantUML <http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml>`__
        
        Some experimental features are also available as `feature branches <https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/sismic/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22feature+branch%22>`__.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Sismic can be installed using ``pip`` as usual: ``pip install sismic``.
        This will install the latest stable version.
        
        You can also install Sismic from this repository by cloning it.
        The development occurs in the *devel* branch, the latest stable distributed version is in the *master* branch.
        
        Sismic requires Python >=3.4
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The documentation for the latest distributed version is available on `sismic.readthedocs.io <http://sismic.readthedocs.io/>`_.
        
        Many examples are available in `docs/examples <https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/sismic/tree/devel/docs/examples>`_.
        
        The documentation can also be directly built from the `docs <https://github.com/AlexandreDecan/sismic/tree/devel/docs>`_ directory using Sphinx.
