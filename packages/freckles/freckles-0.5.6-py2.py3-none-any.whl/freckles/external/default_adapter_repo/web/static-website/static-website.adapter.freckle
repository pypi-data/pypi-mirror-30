    Installs and configures a webserver to publish a static website.

    'nginx' is used as the webserver, 'apache' might be supported as an option later. If you set the 'letsencrypt_email' variable this adapter will request a https certificate for the domain set in 'static_website_domain', as well as a cron job to renew it before it runs out. So, for this to work you'll obviously need to have configured dns correctly for the server this is running on.

    Supported:
      - for now, only Debian Stretch is supported
