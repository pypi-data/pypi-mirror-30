# frocker

A shell script to be used in association with a [freckle folder](https://docs.freckles.io/en/latest/freckelize_command.html), helping to do [Docker](https://docker.com) specific tasks. [freckles](https://github.com/makkus/freckles) itself does not have to be installed on the host machine to use it, only Docker.
