    The FMRI population model

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample : Sample
    formula_like : str
        A formula like object that is understood by patsy.
    exog : ndarray
        If None, will be created from formula_like
        Directly specifying a design matrix, i.e., providing exog
        will take presendence from the formula interface.
    mask : None, bool, ndarray, or str
        If False or None, the population model will be fitted only
        at points, at which the population model is identifiable.
        If True or 'template', the population model will,
        additionally, only be fitted at points, at which the
        template in the population has valid intensities (i.e. > 0
        and not NAN). If 'sample', the population model will be
        fitted only at points at which the sample provides valid
        summary statistics for *all* fields in the sample.
