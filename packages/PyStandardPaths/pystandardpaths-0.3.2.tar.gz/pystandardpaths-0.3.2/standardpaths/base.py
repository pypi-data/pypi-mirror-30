    such as :func:`.get_writable_path` and :func:`.get_standard_paths`.

    Some of the values in this enum represent a user configuration. Such enum
    values will return the same paths in different applications, so they could
    be used to share data with other applications. Other values are specific to
    this application. Each enum value in the table below describes whether it's
    application-specific or generic.

    Application-specific directories should be assumed to be unreachable by
    other applications. Therefore, files placed there might not be readable by
    other applications, even if run by the same user. On the other hand,
    generic directories should be assumed to be accessible by all applications
    run by this user, but should still be assumed to be unreachable by
    applications by other users.

    Data interchange with other users is out of the scope of PyStandardPaths.
