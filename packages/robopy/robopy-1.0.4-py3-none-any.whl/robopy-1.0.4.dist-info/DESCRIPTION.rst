ROBOPY is a python implimentation of The Robotics Toolbox (RTB) (The brainchild of Peter Corke) for Matlab. The toolbox provides a range of functions that are useful in the study and simulation of classical arm-type robotics including kinematics, dynamics and trajectory generation. Via the porting of the toolbox we hope to create greater access to the toolbox without the need for pricy software subscriptions.
