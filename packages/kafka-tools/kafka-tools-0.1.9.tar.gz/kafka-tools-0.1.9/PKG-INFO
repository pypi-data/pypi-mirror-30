Description: Kafka Tools
        ===========
        
        This repository is a collection of tools for working with
        `Apache Kafka <http://kafka.apache.org>`_.
        
        The Site Reliability team for Kafka at LinkedIn has built these over time in
        order to make managing Kafka a little bit easier. Our intention is to add to
        this repository as more tools are developed.
        
        We welcome additions and modifications that make managing Kafka better for all!
