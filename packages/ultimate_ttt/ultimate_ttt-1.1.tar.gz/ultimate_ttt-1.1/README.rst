The rest of this readme is for developers working on adding features to the game engine. If this is you:

Running Tests
-------------

You should always, *always* be writing tests and then writing functionality that makes these pass.

You (and Travis CI) can see that all our tests pass, run :code:`setup.py test`, or :code:`pytest` (after installing pytest) in the root directory.
