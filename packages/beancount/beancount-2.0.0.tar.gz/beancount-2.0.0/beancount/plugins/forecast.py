"""An example of adding a forecasting feature to Beancount via a plugin.

This entry filter plugin uses existing syntax to define and automatically
inserted transactions in the future based on a convention. It serves mostly as
an example of how you can experiment by creating and installing a local filter,
and not so much as a serious forecasting feature (though the experiment is a
good way to get something more general kickstarted eventually, I think the
concept would generalize nicely and should eventually be added as a comon
feature of Beancount).

A user can create a create a transaction like this:

  2014-03-08 # "Electricity bill [MONTHLY]""
    Expenses:Electricity 			50.10 USD
    Assets:Checking			       -50.10 USD

and new transactions will be created monthly for the following year.
Note the use of the '#' flag and the word 'MONTHLY' which defines the
periodicity. This needs more expansion, but as an example, it works.
