Wraps around icecast2 and ezstream (or ices0) to create a radio station with possibly very complicated playlist system.
Configures icecast2 and ezstream automatically, so you don't have to.
Playlists can be very simple, like a shuffle, or complicated, with time slots, jingles and prerolls.
Includes a simple web UI to operate the radio.
