## Introduction

bifacialvf is a self-contained view factor (or configuration factor)
model which replicates a 5-row PV system of infinite extent perpendicular to the module rows. 
Single-axis tracking is supported, and hourly output files based on TMY inputs 
are saved.  Spatial nonuniformity is reported, with multiple rear-facing irradiances collected
on the back of each module row.

## Pre-requisites
This software is written for Anaconda Python 2.7 which can be downloaded here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Install using pip

1. Clone or download the bifacialvf repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory where setup.py is located: `cd bifacialvf-master`
3. Install via pip: `pip install .`
4. Alternate installation development mode: `pip install -e .`

## Usage

```
import bifacialvf

bifacialvf.simulate(inputTMY, outputfile, tilt, azm, clearance, rowspacing)
(data, metadata) = bifacialvf.loadVFresults(outputfile)
```
For more usage examples, see the Jupyter notebooks in \docs\

## Prerequisites

*none


## Main Functions
`bifacialvf.simulate(TMYtoread, writefiletitle,  beta, sazm, C = 1, D = 0.5,
             rowType = 'interior', transFactor = 0.01, cellRows = 6, 
             PVfrontSurface = 'glass', PVbackSurface = 'glass',  albedo = 0.62,  
             tracking = False, backtrack = False, r2r = 1.5, Cv= 0.05, offset = 0)`:  

This is the main runfile.  Hourly TMY3 inputs are read, and an outputfile is saved with
a number of irradiance points along the module chord specified by 'cellRows'.


`loadVFresults.loadVFresults(filename = none)` : 
read in saved file from bifacialvf.simulate.  If no filename is passed, a tkinter GUI opens for file selection

## Subroutines

`sun.py`: 
Solar position and irradiance-related helper files including
hrSolarPos, perezComp, solarPos, and sunIncident

`vf.py`:
View Factor helper files to help with configuration-factor calculation
1-axis tracking and self-shading calculation.
Subroutines include:
getBackSurfaceIrradiances, getFrontSurfaceIrradiances, getGroundShadeFactors,
getSkyConfigurationFactors, trackingBFvaluescalculator, rowSpacing
