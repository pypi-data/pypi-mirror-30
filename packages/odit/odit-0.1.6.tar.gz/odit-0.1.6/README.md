## The Nocturnal One


This is just a proof of concept to generate build document using Microsoft Azure.


### Features

1) Generates Build document
2) All Resource Groups under a subscription
3) All resource overview under a subscrition
4) All Networks under a subscription
5) All Virtual machines under a subscription

### Purpose 

The idea behind this is to automate build documents as it becomes next to imposible 
to create one when agile process is followed sometimes.

#### Will this be extended

At the moment i have no idea, depends on need of users, if this proves to be a handy tool
i may continue developing it and have other providers integrated in it.
