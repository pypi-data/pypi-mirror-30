Description: License checker
        ==============================
        
        This is a package for verifying that a license file in an open source project has not changed since distribution. Most licenses require inclusion of that license. This checks that it is the case.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        ``$ pip install malicense``
        
        Setup
        -----
        Your project must have a "LICENSE" file in the top directory of the package (not the project). You must take a snapshot of the license with::
        
            $ malicense --snap
        
        Then, git commit to save the snapshot placed in the new file ``.lichash``.
        
        Usage
        -----
        1: UNIX command line executable exits with code 2 if validation fails. In the package top directory::
        
            $ malicense
        
        2: python::
        
            import malicense
            malicense.main(package, snap=False)
            # or
            malicense.main(licfilename='./LICENSE', snap=False)
        
        where ``package`` is the top level directory. A recommended use is putting that code into an "\_\_init\_\_.py" file. Optional arguments are::
        
            def verify(package, warnWith=print, reportTo=None):
            ''' Check the license snapshot and compare to current license
        
                :param str package: top level directory or a python package
                :param func warnWith: function that will be called to say "unlicensed". None or False means it does nothing on invalid
                :param reportTo: more inputs
                :returns bool: True if it is valid
            '''
