Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package adds a new view to Plone's Link content type. If the remote url of
        the link is an oembedable video collective.videolink will
        override the default `link_redirect_view` browserview to show
        the embedded video.

        Why this package ?
        ==================
        
        I needed a way to display video links in a thumbnail gallery style view
        This provides a simple view for collections of video links. 
        This is known to work with videos from youtube and vimeo. It also works with
        soundcloud and other oembedable links.
