        Collections are vital for implementing algorithms: they are the bread an butter of data aggregation and processing.
        For example, a collection can be used to represent the list of ingredients of a recipe.
        Then, you might want your algorithm to scale the ingredients to accommodate a different number of portions than the
        original recipe.
        The Mochila package provides a powerful API to process data in collections in a declarative way.
