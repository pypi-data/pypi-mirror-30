        Cape API Client Module
        ======================
        
        `Cape <https://thecape.ai>`_ is an API from `Bloomsbury AI <http://bloomsbury.ai>`_ that makes it easy to build software that answers questions about the contents of documents. For example, you can use cape to:
        
        
        * Build a super-powered ctrl+f that finds the answer to questions like ‘Who is the CFO?’, rather than just all the occurrences of a keyword.
        * Build an expressive query tool for textual data - extract features with a single question.
        * Build a virtual office assistant that answers routine questions through Slack.
        * Build an add-on to your private search that mimics Google’s ‘direct answers’.
