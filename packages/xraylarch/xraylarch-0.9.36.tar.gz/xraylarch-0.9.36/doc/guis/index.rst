   :synopsis: Graphical User Interfaces


Larch provides several Graphical User Interfaces for easier manipulating,
viewing, and processing of data.  Many of the GUI displays are
inter-related, so that they can bring up the other windows for displaying,
interacting, and processing data.  The main window views are

  * `GSE_Mapviewer`: viewing XRF maps from  X-ray microprobes.
  * `xas_viewer`: read and view XAS data, do simple normalization, and pre-edge peak fitting.
  * `larch_gui`: simple command-line + data browser for Larch.

More details and screenshots are shown in the following pages.
