Modules
==================

As discussed in Section :ref:`tutorial_modules_section`, Larch can import
modules either written in Larch (with a '.lar' extension) or Python (with a
'.py' extension).  When importing a Python module, the full set of Python
objects is imported as a Python module, which acts very much like a Larch
Group.
