A Python package for finite difference derivatives in any number of dimensions.

Features: 

    * Differentiate arrays of any number of dimensions along any axis
    * Partial derivatives of any desired order
    * Accuracy order can be specified
    * Accurate treatment of grid boundary
    * Includes standard operators from vector calculus like gradient, divergence and curl
    * Can handle uniform and non-uniform grids
    * Can handle arbitrary linear combinations of derivatives with constant and variable coefficients
    * Fully vectorized for speed
    * Calculate raw finite difference coefficients for any order and accuracy for uniform and non-uniform grids
