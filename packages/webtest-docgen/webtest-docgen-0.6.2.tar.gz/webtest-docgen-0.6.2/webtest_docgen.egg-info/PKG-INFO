        Story
        -----
        It's always annoying me to build documentation and keep it up to date,
        surly, there is many documentation tools i can choose,
        after all i reviewed some of these tools, and one thing is common!
        all of these has own way and you must learn and add some extra files
        beside of your application.
        
        Inspired by pylover`s restfulpy there is an idea!
        Say Hi to tests, and get your documentation duration of running tests.
        yea, it's awesome, but restfulpy not for a single reason and have own ecosystem
        to do things.
        
        I wanna to improve that's idea independently, with help of RAML 0.8 syntax.
        webtest_docgen respect to your tests already written by webtest.
