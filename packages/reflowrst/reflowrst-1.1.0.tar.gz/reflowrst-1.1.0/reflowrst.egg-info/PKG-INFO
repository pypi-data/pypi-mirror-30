        Usage
        =====
        
        Example:
        
        >>> from reflowrst import reflow
        >>> text = 'Here is a paragraph that is far too long and will need to wrap.'
        >>> print(reflow(text, 47))
        Here is a paragraph that is far too long and
        will need to wrap.
        
        You can also get the longest possible form of the rst text by using 0
        for the space. For example:
        
        >>> paragraph = '''Here is a paragraph that is far too long and
        will need to wrap.'''
        >>> print(reflow(paragraph, 0))
        Here is a paragraph that is far too long and will need to wrap.
