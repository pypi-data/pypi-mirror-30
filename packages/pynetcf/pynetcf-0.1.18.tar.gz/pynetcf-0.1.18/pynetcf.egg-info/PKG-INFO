        Description
        ===========
        
        Basic python classes that map to netCDF files on disk written according to the [Climate and Forecast metadata conventions](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html) 
        
        This is a first draft which has a lot of room for improvements, this is especially true for the time series based representations.
