Description: Headless PDFKit
        ===============
        
        The PDFKit package makes use of `wkhtmltopdf`, which in turn needs an X Server
        to run. In Debian land, this generally requires `xvfb-run` wrapper.
        
        The ``headless_pdfkit`` package tries to make the `hotfix`_ proposed by
        `jakewins`_ a bit easier to work with.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install ``headless_pdfkit`` by running::
        
            pip install headless-pdfkit
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Save a simple PDF from string.::
        
            ret = headless_pdfkit.generate_pdf('<html></html>')
            with open('output.pdf', 'wb') as w:
                w.write(ret)
