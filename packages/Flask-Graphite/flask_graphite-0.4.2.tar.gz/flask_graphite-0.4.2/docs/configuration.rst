Configuring Flask-Graphite
==========================

How to configure Flask-Graphite?
--------------------------------

You can configure Flask-Graphite through the Flask application's configuration.

The ``FLASK_GRAPHITE_`` namespace will be fetched from the application's
configuration and used as Flask-Graphite own configuration.

------------------

Here is a succint list of the different options available, and their respective
meanings. The prefix ``FLASK_GRAPHITE_`` is removed for readability.
