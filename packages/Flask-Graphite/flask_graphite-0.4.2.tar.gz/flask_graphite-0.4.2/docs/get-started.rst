Complete example
----------------

Here is a complete example of an application using FlaskGraphite

Write this code in a `test.py` file::

    from flask import Flask, jsonify
    from flask_graphite import FlaskGraphite


    metric_sender = FlaskGraphite()

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config["FLASK_GRAPHITE_HOST"] = "localhost"
    app.config["FLASK_GRAPHITE_PORT"] = 2023

    metric_sender.init_app(app)


    @app.route("/foo")
    def foo():
        return jsonify({"test": "foo"})


    @app.route("/bar")
    def bar():
        return jsonify({"test": "bar"})


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(host="localhost", port=5000)

Run this example
----------------

You can launch the server:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python test.py

You can then make requests to the server:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl http://localhost:5000/foo
    $ curl http://localhost:5000/bar

By doing this, the `foo` view will be executed, and thanks to the
Flask-Graphite plugin, a number of metrics will be available on your graphite
server.

.. warning::
    A running instance of carbon-aggregator is needed. See :ref:`aggregator`

Generated metrics
-----------------

When you run this example, the application will send several metrics to your
local instance of carbon.

You can see these metrics in the directory used by carbon to store the metrics
(by default ``/var/lib/carbon/whisper/``).

You will see that a different set of metric has been generated for the ``foo``
and the ``bar`` view. For each of them, you have access to the
:ref:`standard metrics <standard metrics>`
