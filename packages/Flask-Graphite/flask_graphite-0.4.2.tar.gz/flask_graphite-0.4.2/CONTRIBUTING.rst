Quality
=======

We try to maintain a high level of quality in this project. This means the
tests should be meaningful and test for regression, and that the documentation
should be as complete as possible.

If you open a merge request, please ask yourself these questions:
 * Should I document what I implemented? (probably yes unless it's a minor
   fix)
 * Should I write a test to ensure future behaviour?
