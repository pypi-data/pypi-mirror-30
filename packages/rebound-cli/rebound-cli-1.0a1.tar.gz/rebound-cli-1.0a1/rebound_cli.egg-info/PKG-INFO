Description: Rebound
        =======
        
        Rebound automatically displays Stack Overflow search results in your
        terminal when you get a compiler error. Just use the ``rebound`` command
        before the file you want to execute.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install rebound with pip (homebrew coming soon):
        
        ``$ pip install rebound-cli``
        
        Requires Python 2.0 or higher. OS X, Linux, and Windows are all
        supported.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Compiling a file with rebound is as simple as doing it normally. Just
        run:
        
        ``$ rebound [file_name]``
        
        This will execute the file, catch any compiler errors, and prompt you to
        browse related Stack Overflow questions/answers. Rebound currently
        supports Python and NodeJS files. Support for Ruby and Java is coming
        soon!
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        Rebound is written in Python and built on Urwid. Beautiful Soup is used
        to scrape Stack Overflow content and subprocess is used to catch
        compiler errors.
