Rebound automatically displays Stack Overflow search results in your
terminal when you get a compiler error. Just use the ``rebound`` command
before the file you want to execute.

Installation
------------

You can install rebound with pip (homebrew coming soon):

``$ pip install rebound-cli``

Requires Python 2.0 or higher. OS X, Linux, and Windows are all
supported.

Usage
-----

Compiling a file with rebound is as simple as doing it normally. Just
run:

``$ rebound [file_name]``

This will execute the file, pull the error message, and allow you to
browse related Stack Overflow questions/answers without leaving the
terminal.

**Supported file types:** Python, Node.js, Ruby, and Java.

Contributing
------------

To make a contribution, fork the repo, make your changes and then submit
a pull request. If youâ€™ve discovered a bug or have a feature request,
create an `issue`_ and tag it appropriately :)

Rebound is written in Python and built on Urwid. Beautiful Soup is used
to scrape Stack Overflow content and subprocess for catching compiler
errors.
