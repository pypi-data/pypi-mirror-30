# What can I use it for?
You can use it for various purposes, some examples include:
* maintaining live order book
* recording trade history
* analysing order flow

Use your imagination.

# Notices
**27/03/2018**

Bittrex has published officicial beta [documentation](https://github.com/Bittrex/beta).

**17/03/2018**

I have just released a new [SignalR client](https://github.com/slazarov/python-signalr-client) based on asyncio. I plan to replace the existing one that uses gevent.
The main implications are that support is going to transition to Python3.5+ because asyncio does not support lower versions.

# Road map
* Implementation of new changes with respect to the published official documentation.
* Development of new improved async version of the socket.
* Socket reconnection handling

    ~~* Implemented but experimental~~
* ~~More user friendly subscription to the exchange channels.~~
* ~~Pypi~~
* Test scripts

# Dependencies
To successfully install the package the following dependencies must be met:
* [cfscrape](https://github.com/Anorov/cloudflare-scrape) requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

    If you receive `Missing Node.js runtime. Node is required...` error as documented in [Issue #12](https://github.com/slazarov/python-bittrex-websocket/issues/12#issuecomment-354078963), you will have to install Node.js. This error usually shows for Windows users.

* [requests[security]](https://github.com/requests/requests)
  * g++, make, libffi-dev, openssl-dev
* [signalr-client](https://github.com/TargetProcess/signalr-client-py)
  * g++, make

I have added a Dockerfile for Ð° quick setup. Please check the docker folder. The example.py is not always up to date.

I am only adding this as a precaution, in most case you will not have to do anything at all as these are prepackaged with your python installation.

```

# Message channels
The websocket clients starts a separate thread upon initialization with further subthreads for each connection (currently 20 tickers per connection). There are several methods which could be overwritten. Please check the actual code for further information and examples.
```python
def on_open(self):
    # Called before initiating the first websocket connection
    # Use it when you want to add some opening logic.

def on_close(self):
    # Called before closing the websocket instance.
    # Use it when you want to add any closing logic.

def on_error(self, error):
    # Error handler

def on_orderbook(self, msg):
    # The main channel of subscribe_to_orderbook().

def on_orderbook_update(self, msg):
    # The main channel of subscribe_to_orderbook_update().

def on_trades(self, msg):
    # The main channel of subscribe_to_trades().

def on_ticker_update(self, msg):
    # The main channel of subscribe_to_ticker_update().
```

# Sample usage
To receive live data feed you must instantiate the websocket and use one of its subscribe methods. For the various subscription methods check above. Example:
##### Subscribe to a single ticker
```python
# Tickers
tickers = ['ETH-ZEC'] # use lists
ws = MySocket()
ws.subscribe_to_orderbook(tickers)
# Do some stuff and trade for infinite profit
ws.disconnect()
```
##### Subscribe to multiple tickers
```python
# Tickers
tickers = ['BTC-ETH', 'BTC-NEO', 'BTC-ZEC', 'ETH-NEO', 'ETH-ZEC'] # use lists
ws = MySocket()
ws.subscribe_to_ticker_update(tickers)
# Do some stuff and trade for infinite profit
ws.disconnect()
```

Let's get some 'practical' examples.

Note that with library updates, the methods and data structure might change, so check the examples folder for the most up to date examples.
#### Record trades
```python
from __future__ import print_function
from time import sleep
from bittrex_websocket.websocket_client import BittrexSocket


def main():
    class MySocket(BittrexSocket):
        def on_open(self):
            self.trade_history = {}

        def on_trades(self, msg):
            # Create entry for the ticker in the trade_history dict
            if msg['ticker'] not in self.trade_history:
                self.trade_history[msg['ticker']] = []
            # Add history nounce
            self.trade_history[msg['ticker']].append(msg)
            # Ping
            print('[Trades]: {}'.format(msg['ticker']))

    # Create the socket instance
    ws = MySocket()
    # Enable logging
    ws.enable_log()
    # Define tickers
    tickers = ['BTC-ETH', 'BTC-XMR']
    # Subscribe to trade fills
    ws.subscribe_to_trades(tickers)

    while len(set(tickers) - set(ws.trade_history)) > 0:
        sleep(1)
    else:
        for ticker in ws.trade_history.keys():
            print('Printing {} trade history.'.format(ticker))
            for trade in ws.trade_history[ticker]:
                print(trade)
        ws.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Live/Real-time order book
```python
from __future__ import print_function
from time import sleep
from bittrex_websocket.websocket_client import BittrexSocket


def main():
    class MySocket(BittrexSocket):
        def on_orderbook(self, msg):
            print('[OrderBook]: {}'.format(msg['MarketName']))

    # Create the socket instance
    ws = MySocket()
    # Enable logging
    ws.enable_log()
    # Define tickers
    tickers = ['BTC-ETH', 'BTC-NEO', 'BTC-ZEC', 'ETH-NEO', 'ETH-ZEC']
    # Subscribe to live order book
    ws.subscribe_to_orderbook(tickers)

    while True:
        i = 0
        sync_states = ws.get_order_book_sync_state()
        for state in sync_states.values():
            if state == 3:
                i += 1
        if i == len(tickers):
            print('We are fully synced. Hooray!')
            for ticker in tickers:
                ob = ws.get_order_book(ticker)
                name = ob['MarketName']
                quantity = str(ob['Buys'][0]['Quantity'])
                price = str(ob['Buys'][0]['Rate'])
                print('Ticker: ' + name + ', Bids depth 0: ' + quantity + '@' + price)
            ws.disconnect()
            break
        else:
            sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
#### Ticker general information update
```python
from __future__ import print_function
from time import sleep
from bittrex_websocket.websocket_client import BittrexSocket


def main():
    class MySocket(BittrexSocket):
        def on_open(self):
            self.ticker_updates_container = {}

        def on_ticker_update(self, msg):
            name = msg['MarketName']
            if name not in self.ticker_updates_container:
                self.ticker_updates_container[name] = msg
                print('Just received ticker update for {}.'.format(name))

    # Create the socket instance
    ws = MySocket()
    # Enable logging
    ws.enable_log()
    # Define tickers
    tickers = ['BTC-ETH', 'BTC-NEO', 'BTC-ZEC', 'ETH-NEO', 'ETH-ZEC']
    # Subscribe to ticker information
    ws.subscribe_to_ticker_update(tickers)

    while len(ws.ticker_updates_container) < len(tickers):
        sleep(1)
    else:
        print('We have received updates for all tickers. Closing...')
        ws.disconnect()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# Change log
0.0.7.1 - 31/03/2018
* Removed wsaccel: no particular socket benefits
* Fixed RecursionError as per [Issue #52](https://github.com/slazarov/python-bittrex-websocket/issues/52)

0.0.7.0 - 25/02/2018
* New reconnection methods implemented. Problem was within `gevent`, because connection failures within it are not raised in the main script.
* Added wsaccel for better socket performance.
* Set websocket-client minimum version to 0.47.0

0.0.6.4 - 24/02/2018
* Fixed order book syncing bug when more than 1 connection is online due to wrong connection/thread name.

0.0.6.3 - 18/02/2018
* Major changes to how the code handles order book syncing. Syncing is done significantly faster than previous versions, i.e full sync of all Bittrex tickers takes ca. 4 minutes.
* Fixed `on_open` bug as per [Issue #21](https://github.com/slazarov/python-bittrex-websocket/issues/21)

0.0.6.2.2
* Update cfscrape>=1.9.2 and gevent>=1.3a1
* Reorder imports in websocket_client to safeguard against SSL recursion errors.

0.0.6.2
* Every 5400s (1hr30) the script will force reconnection.
* Every reconnection (including the above) will be done with a fresh cookie
* Upon reconnection the script will check if the connection has been running for more than 600s (10mins). If it has been running for less it will use the backup url.

0.0.6.1
* Set websocket-client==0.46.0

0.0.6
* Reconnection - Experimental
* Fixed a bug when subscribing to multiple subscription types at once resulted in opening unnecessary connections even though there is sufficient capacity in the existing [Commit 7fd21c](https://github.com/slazarov/python-bittrex-websocket/commit/7fd21cad87a8bd7c88070bab0fd5774b0324332e)
* Numerous code optimizations

0.0.5.1
* Updated cfscrape minimum version requirement ([Issue #12](https://github.com/slazarov/python-bittrex-websocket/issues/12)).

0.0.5
* Fixed [Issue #9](https://github.com/slazarov/python-bittrex-websocket/issues/9) relating to `subscribe_to_orderbook_update` handling in internal method `_on_tick_update`
* Added custom logger as per [PR #10](https://github.com/slazarov/python-bittrex-websocket/issues/10) and [Issue #8](https://github.com/slazarov/python-bittrex-websocket/issues/8) in order to avoid conflicts with other `basicConfig` setups
  * Added two new methods `enable_log` and `disable_log`. Check [Other Methods](#other-methods).
  * Logging is now disabled on startup. You have to enable it.
* **Experimental**: Calling `subscribe_to_ticker_update` without a specified ticker subscribes to all tickers in the message stream ([Issue #4](https://github.com/slazarov/python-bittrex-websocket/issues/4)).
* Minor code optimizations (removed unnecessary class Common)

0.0.4 - Changed the behaviour of how on_ticker_update channel works:
The message now contains a single ticker instead of a dictionary of all subscribed tickers.

0.0.3 - Removed left over code from initial release version that was throwing errors (had no effect on performance).

0.0.2 - Major improvements:

* Additional un/subscribe and order book sync state querying methods added.
* Better connection and thread management.
* Code optimisations
* Better code documentation
* Added additional connection URLs

0.0.1 - Initial release on github.

# Other libraries
**[Python Bittrex Autosell](https://github.com/slazarov/python-bittrex-autosell)**

Python CLI tool to auto sell coins on Bittrex.

It is used in the cases when you want to auto sell a specific coin for another, but there is no direct market, so you have to use an intermediate market.

# Motivation
I am fairly new to Python and in my experience the best way to learn something is through actual practice. At the same time I am currently actively trading on Bittrex, hence the reason why I decided to build the Bittrex websocket client. I am publishing my code for a few reasons. Firstly, I want to make a contribution to the community, secondly the code needs lots of improvements and it would be great to work on it as a team, thirdly I haven't seen any other Python Bittrex websocket clients so far.

I have been largely motivated by the following projects and people:

* Daniel Paquin: [gdax-python](https://github.com/danpaquin/gdax-python) - a websocket client for GDAX. The project really helped me around using threads and structuring the code.

* [David Parlevliet](https://github.com/dparlevliet) - saw his SignalR code initially which included Bittrex specific commands. Saved me a lot of time in researching.

* Eric Somdahl: [python-bittrex](https://github.com/ericsomdahl/python-bittrex) - great python bindings for Bittrex. Highly recommend it, I use it in conjuction with the websocket client.
