`wpgtk` uses [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) as it's colorscheme generator, but builds upon it with a UI and other features, such as the abilty to mix and edit the colorschemes generated and save them with their respective wallpapers, having light and dark themes, hackable and fast GTK+ theme made specifically for `wpgtk` and custom keywords and values to replace in templates.

In short, `wpgtk` is a colorscheme/wallpaper manager with a template system attached which let's you create templates from any textfile and will replace keywords on it on the fly, allowing for great styling and theming possibilities.
