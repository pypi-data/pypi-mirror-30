Password reset for the Django admin interface
=============================================

This package provides views, to use the built-in Django password reset
functionality from inside the admin interface.

Features:

* Add a link to the top of the user change form, that leads to a new page,
  containing the link for the password reset.
* Remove the features to manually change the users' passwords from the admin
  interface (but see note below).
  * Remove the change password link from the user forms.
  * Remove the password inputs from the user add form.

.. note::
   It's still possible to manually change the users' passwords, by going to
   the ``/admin/auth/user/<uid>/password/`` page. Only the links,
   pointing to this e are removed.

Installation
------------

The django-admin-reset package can be installed with pip::

   pip install django-admin-reset

Usage
-----

To use this package, add it to ``INSTALLED_APPS``,
in the ``settings.py`` file::

   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'django_admin_reset',
       ...
   ]

Validation time
---------------

The password reset links/tokens, generated by this package, are using the built-in
Django password reset functionality, and so respect the
``PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT_DAYS`` setting.

Compatibility
-------------

This package changes the default user admin class, so it may be incompatible
with other packages, that are also changing it.
