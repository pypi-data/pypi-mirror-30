# FrozenOrderedBidict intentionally does not subclass frozenbidict because it only complicates the
# inheritance hierarchy without providing any actual code reuse: The only thing from frozenbidict
# that FrozenOrderedBidict uses is frozenbidict.__hash__(), but Python specifically prevents
# __hash__ from being inherited; it must instead always be defined explicitly as below. Users who
# need an `is_frozenbidict(..)` test that succeeds for both frozenbidicts and FrozenOrderedBidicts
# should therefore not use isinstance(foo, frozenbidict), but should instead use the appropriate
# ABCs, e.g. `isinstance(foo, BidirectionalMapping) and not isinstance(foo, MutableMapping)`.
