#   **keyup** |  Automated IAM Access Key Rotation for Amazon Web Services
* * *

## Purpose ##

`keyup` automates IAM user access key rotation from the cli.  

**Keyup**:

* is a safe, error-free mechanism to rotate (renew) access keys to Amazon Web Services as  
frequently as you wish, with minimal effort and risk.
* enables you to change your access keys when required by executing a single command from the cli.  
* Alternatively, enter a keyup command in your crontab with the ``` --auto ``` parameter and renew access  
keys on a daily schedule.
* **keyup** requires only the profile name of your IAM user in your local [awscli configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/):

```bash

    $ keyup --profile johndoe --operation up

```

* * *

## Options ##

Diplay help menu

```bash

    $ keyup -h

```
