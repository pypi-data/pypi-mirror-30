           Tensorpack
        Tensorpack is a training interface based on TensorFlow.

        Features:
        ---------
        
        It's Yet Another TF wrapper, but different in:
        
        1. Focus on **training speed**.
        
           -  Speed comes for free with tensorpack -- it uses TensorFlow in the
              **efficient way** with no extra overhead. On different CNNs, it
              runs `1.2~5x
              faster <https://github.com/tensorpack/benchmarks/tree/master/other-wrappers>`__
              than the equivalent Keras code.
        
           -  Data-parallel multi-GPU training is off-the-shelf to use. It
              scales as well as Google's `official
              benchmark <https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/benchmarks>`__.
        
           -  See
              `tensorpack/benchmarks <https://github.com/tensorpack/benchmarks>`__
              for the benchmark scripts.
        
        2. Focus on **large datasets**.
        
           -  It's unnecessary to read/preprocess data with a new language
              called TF. Tensorpack helps you load large datasets (e.g.
              ImageNet) in **pure Python** with autoparallelization.
        
        3. It's not a model wrapper.
        
           -  There are too many symbolic function wrappers in the world.
              Tensorpack includes only a few common models. But you can use any
              symbolic function library inside tensorpack, including
              tf.layers/Keras/slim/tflearn/tensorlayer/....
        
        See
        `tutorials <http://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html>`__
        to know more about these features.
        
        `Examples <examples>`__:
        ------------------------
        
        Instead of showing you 10 random networks with random accuracy,
        `tensorpack examples <examples>`__ faithfully replicate papers and care
        about performance. And everything runs on multiple GPUs. Some
        highlights:
        
        Vision:
        ~~~~~~~
        
        -  `Train ResNet <examples/ResNet>`__ and `other
           models <examples/ImageNetModels>`__ on ImageNet.
        -  `Train Faster-RCNN / Mask-RCNN on COCO object
           detection <examples/FasterRCNN>`__
        -  `Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) variants <examples/GAN>`__,
           including DCGAN, InfoGAN, Conditional GAN, WGAN, BEGAN, DiscoGAN,
           Image to Image, CycleGAN.
        -  `DoReFa-Net: train binary / low-bitwidth CNN on
           ImageNet <examples/DoReFa-Net>`__
        -  `Fully-convolutional Network for Holistically-Nested Edge
           Detection(HED) <examples/HED>`__
        -  `Spatial Transformer Networks on MNIST
           addition <examples/SpatialTransformer>`__
        -  `Visualize CNN saliency maps <examples/Saliency>`__
        -  `Similarity learning on MNIST <examples/SimilarityLearning>`__
        
        Reinforcement Learning:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  `Deep Q-Network(DQN) variants on Atari
           games <examples/DeepQNetwork>`__, including DQN, DoubleDQN,
           DuelingDQN.
        -  `Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic(A3C) with demos on OpenAI
           Gym <examples/A3C-Gym>`__
        
        Speech / NLP:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  `LSTM-CTC for speech recognition <examples/CTC-TIMIT>`__
        -  `char-rnn for fun <examples/Char-RNN>`__

        Install:
        --------
        
        Dependencies:
        
        -  Python 2.7 or 3
        -  Python bindings for OpenCV (Optional, but required by a lot of
           features)
        -  TensorFlow >= 1.3.0 (Optional if you only want to use
           ``tensorpack.dataflow`` alone as a data processing library)
        
           ::
        
               # install git, then:
               pip install -U git+https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack.git
               # or add `--user` to avoid system-wide installation.
