Description: S3 backup rotate
        ================
        
        Backup your files to Amazon Web Services in a way that slowly forgets! I've learned that this way is refered to as the ['Grandfather, father, son'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_rotation_scheme#Grandfather-father-son) strategy.
        
        This script copies a file to Amazon S3 and rotates it.
        
        The filename will have a date stamp added before the first . in the filename. *Do not* add a timestamp yourself, this will cause the script to treat the file as a unique file and the rotation won't work!
        
        Rotation works as follows:
        - Keep files from the last X days
        - After that, keep Y files spaced at least a week apart
        - After that, keep Z files spaced at least 30 days apart
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install s3-backup-rotate`
        
        ## Usage
        
        Export the following environment variables:
        - `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=yourkeyidhere`
        - `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yoursecretkey`
        
        You can also use one of the other methods supported by boto.
        
        `upload_rotate.py bucket prefix file`.
        
        See `python upload_rotate.py -h` for more info.
