Alcathous [1]_ is the brother of Copreus. Both are sons of Pelops.
[`wiki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcathous,_son_of_Pelops>`__]

This software subscribes to mqtt-topics that contain raw sensor data and
publishes average values for configurable time spans.

For Users
=========

Installation Core-Functionality
-------------------------------

Prerequisites for the core functionality are:

::

    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt pyyaml

Install via pip:

::

    sudo pip3 install alcathous

To update to the latest version add ``--upgrade`` as prefix to the
``pip3`` line above.

Install via gitlab (might need additional packages):

::

    git clone git@gitlab.com:pelops/alcathous.git
    cd alcathous
    sudo python3 setup.py install

This will install the following shell scripts: \* ``alcathous``

The script cli arguments are: \* '-c'/'--config' - config file
(mandatory) \* '-v' - verbose output (optional) \* '--version' - show
the version number and exit

YAML-Config
-----------

A yaml [2]_ file must contain four root blocks: \* mqtt - mqtt-address,
mqtt-port, and path to credentials file mqtt-credentials (a file
consisting of two entries: mqtt-user, mqtt-password) \* general -
parameters for the manager \* methods - mapping of algorithms,
parameters and topic-pub suffix \* datapoints - which topics should be
used and which methods should be applied

::

    mqtt:
        mqtt-address: localhost
        mqtt-port: 1883
        mqtt-credentials: ~/mqtt_credentials.yaml

    general:
        no_data_behavior: last_valid  # mute, last_valid, empty_message
        update_cycle: 30  # new values published each ... seconds
        number_worker: 4  # how many worker threads should be spawned to process task queue

    methods:
        avg_5min:
            topic-pub-suffix: avg_5min
            algorithm: avg  # avg - average, wavg - weighted average
            time_window: 5  # use the values from the last ... minutes

        avg_1min:
            topic-pub-suffix: avg_1min
            algorithm: avg  # avg - average, wavg - weighted average
            time_window: 1  # use the values from the last ... minutes

        wavg_5min:
            topic-pub-suffix: wavg_5min
            algorithm: wavg  # avg - average, wavg - weighted average
            time_window: 5  # use the values from the last ... minutes

    datapoints:
        - topic-sub: /temperature/raw
          topic-pub-prefix: /temperature/
          zero_is_valid: False  # 0 is valid or rejected
          methods: wavg_5min, avg_1min, avg_5min

        - topic-sub: /humidity/raw
          topic-pub-prefix: /humidity/
          zero_is_valid: False  # 0 is valid or rejected
          methods: avg_5min

For Developers
==============

Getting Started
---------------

The project consists of three main modules: \* ``datapointmanager`` -
loads the config and create all ``Datapoint`` instances. Hosts the main
loop. \* ``datapoint`` - ``Datapoint`` is one of the datapoints in the
config. it holds all data received for the given topic, has its own set
of method instances. \* ``algorithms`` - The configureable algorithms
are then used as data preparation methods in ``DataPoint``. Currently,
two algorithms are implemented: Average and WeightedAverage. The first
one treats all values in a time window equivalent, the later one weights
them with the time span between ``time_from`` and ``time_value``.

``DataPointManager`` has two lists: references to the ``process``
functions from all instantiated methods and a references to the
``purge`` functions from all instantiated ``DataPoint``\ s. The first
list is ordered by an execution cost estimation (highest value first).
Both lists are applied to worker threads (``general.number_worker``) -
please adapt the number of the workers to your needs.

Todos
-----

-  Add more algorithms
-  Sanity check of yaml config
-  Automated unit tests
-  ...

Misc
----

The code is written for ``python3`` (and tested with python 3.5 on an
Raspberry Pi Zero with Raspbian Stretch).

.. [1]
   The icon used for this project is in fact not Alcathous. Moreover, it
   is Odysseus and resembles perfectly my failed journey to find a
   fitting symbol.

.. [2]
   Currently, pyyaml is yaml 1.1 compliant. In pyyaml On/Off and Yes/No
   are automatically converted to True/False. This is an unwanted
   behavior and deprecated in yaml 1.2. In copreus this autoconversion
   is removed. Thus, On/Off and Yes/No are read from the yaml file as
   strings (see module baseclasses.mypyyaml).
