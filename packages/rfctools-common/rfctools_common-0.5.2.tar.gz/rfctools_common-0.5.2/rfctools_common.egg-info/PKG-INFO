Description: RFC Editor Tools Utility Code
        =============================
        
        This module contains a set of utility functions used by some of the RFC Editor tools.
        Long term, the goal is to incorperate these functions back into xml2rfc but having it
        separate allows for an easier modification of the functions as needed.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 0.5.2 (Fri 30 MAR)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
        	* Distribute the old rfc 2629 dtd and ent files so that v2 files parse correctly
        	* Correct processing so that we can play games with where to search file files.
        	  If the file does not exist and the source directory is given then strip the
        	  path so that we will search in different directories for the file.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.5.1 (Sun XX MAR)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
        	* Setup to publish to PyPI
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.5.0 (Sun 25 Feb)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
        	* Setup log routines so that UTF-8 strings can be written on
        	  all consoles.  This is a problem as Python v2 thinks consoles
        	  are written assumed to be ASCII and for Windows it is the code
        	  page of the console.  Pipes have a third method of making this decision
        	* Swap the order of two attributes to match the order in the
        	  xmlrfc v2 to v3 upgrade program.
