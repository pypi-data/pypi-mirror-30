An Encyclopedia is an abstract container intended for smallish data sets which provides many of the benefits of a relational (and non-relational) database but with lower syntactic friction.  In particular, an Encyclopedia uses arithmetic expressions typical of first-class python objects (e.g. lists, dictionaries) to perform common dataset operations such as merging, subsetting and object combination. Encyclopedias supports functional composition so as to act on entire Encyclopedias in a single statement similar to data frame vectorization.
