        ==================================
        
        Switch from ``print`` to ``debugger()`` and never look back!
        
        ::
        
            import debug
            debugger()
        
        Import this module in your main file to add ``debugger`` as a builtin
        command.
        
        Calling ``debugger`` opens the ``ipdb`` debugger.
