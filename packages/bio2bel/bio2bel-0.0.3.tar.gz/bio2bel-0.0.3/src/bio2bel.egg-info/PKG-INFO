Description: Bio2BEL
        =======
        Bio2BEL is a project aimed at bringing biological databases in a wide variety of schemata into the unified framework
        of Biological Expression Language.
        
        This package provides a command line interface through which other bio2bel packages can be linked.
        
        Project Structure
        =================
        All Bio2BEL projects should have a similar structure. In the top level, there should be certain modules:
        
        - ``manager.py`` should include a class called ``Manager`` that has a function ``Manager.populate()``
        - ``cli.py`` should have a main ``click`` group called ``main`` and optionally have commands for ``populate``, ``drop``,
          ``deploy``, and ``web``
        
        How to Register
        ===============
        Bio2BEL uses the entry points loader to find packages in combination with setuptools's ``entry_points`` argument.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           import setuptools
        
           setuptools.setup(
              ...
              entry_points={
                  'bio2bel': [
                      'chembl = bio2bel_chembl',
                  ],
                  'console_scripts': [
                      'bio2bel_chembl = bio2bel_chembl.cli:main',
                  ]
              }
              ...
           )
