Changes
-------

5.6 (2018-04-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Handle ``CompoundSelect`` such as ``SELECT 'foo' UNION SELECT 'bar'``


5.5 (2018-04-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix... last fix :-|


5.4 (2018-04-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix regression that broke using a generator as an expose() function


5.3 (2018-03-15)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The Pyramid ``expose()`` decorator now forwards unrecognized keyword arguments to the proxy
  call


5.2 (2018-03-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Handle extraction of metadata from a ``BinaryExpression`` such as ``SELECT jsonfield['attr']``


5.1 (2018-03-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* When a column has a *default* value, and it is directly computable (i.e. it is not a server
  side default), then extract it into its metadata


5.0 (2017-07-22)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: This release **breaks** backward compatibility in several ways!

* More versatile way to add/override basic metadata information (see
  ``register_sa_type_metadata()``)

* More versatile way to use different JSON library or encode/decode settings (see
  ``register_json_decoder_encoder()``): although the default implementation is still based on
  nssjson__, it is *not* required by default anymore at install time

* Basic metadata changed:

  - the `width` slot for all fields is gone, it's more reasonably computed by the actual UI
    framework in use: it was rather arbitrary anyway, and set to ``length * 10`` for String
    columns

  - the `length` slot is present only for ``String`` columns

  - the `type` slot now basically follows the SQLAlchemy nomenclature, in particular:

    Integer
      is now ``integer`` instead of ``int``

    BigInteger
      is now ``integer``, instead of ``int`` with an arbitrarily different ``width`` than the
      one used for Integer

    Numeric
      is now ``numeric`` instead of ``float``

    DateTime
      is now ``datetime`` instead of ``date`` with `timestamp` set to ``True``

    Time
      is now ``time`` instead of ``date`` with `time` set to ``True``

    Interval
      is now ``interval`` instead of ``string`` with ``timedelta`` set to ``True``

    Text
      is now ``text`` instead of ``string`` with an arbitrary `width` of ``50``

    UnicodeText
      is now ``text```

    Unicode
      is now ``string``

  - the `format` slot for DateTime, Date and Time fields is gone, as it was ExtJS specific

4.8 (2017-06-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Use a tuple instead of a list for the `foreign_keys` slot in metadata, and for the
  `primary_key` too when it is composed by more than one column


4.7 (2017-05-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Properly recognize SA Interval() columns

* Fix a crash when applying a filter on a non-existing column in a statement selecting from a
  function


4.4 (2017-04-01)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Rename filter operator ``CONTAINED`` to ``CONTAINS``, and reimplement it to cover different
  data types, in particular PostgreSQL's ranges


4.3 (2017-03-22)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Minor tweak, no externally visible changes


4.2 (2017-03-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Handle literal columns in core queries


3.5 (2016-12-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix incompatibility issue with SQLAlchemy 1.1.x when using ORM


3.4 (2016-03-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  literals

* Use tox to run the tests


3.3 (2016-02-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
