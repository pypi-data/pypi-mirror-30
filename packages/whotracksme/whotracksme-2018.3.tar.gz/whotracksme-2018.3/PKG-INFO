        This repository contains:
        
        * data on trackers and websites as shown on [whotracks.me](https://whotracks.me) (WTM)
        * database mapping tracker domains to companies
        * code to render the [whotracks.me](https://whotracks.me) site
        
        
        # Installation
        
        Python 3.6 is needed to build the site. We recommend creating a
        [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) (or
        `pipenv`) to install the dependencies.
        
        Furthermore, you will need to [install sass](http://sass-lang.com/install).
        
        
        ## From Pypi
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install whotracksme
        ```
        
        
        ## From source
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install -e .
        ```
        
        That's all you need to get started!
        
        
        # Using the data
        
        To get started with the data, everything you need can be found in
        `whotracksme.data`:
        
        ```python
        from whotracksme.data.loader import DataSource
        
        # available entities
        DataSource().trackers
        DataSource().companies
        DataSource().sites
        ```
        
        For examples of scripts, have a look in the [contrib](./contrib) folder!
        
        
        # Building the site
        
        Building the site requires a few extra dependencies, not installed by default to
        not make the installation heavier than it needs to be. You will need to install
        `whotracksme` from the repository, because not all assets are packaged with
        `whotracksme` released on pypi:
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install -e '.[dev]'
        ```
        
        Once this is done, you will have access to a `whotracksme` entry point that can
        be used this way:
        
        ```sh
        $ whotracksme website [serve]
        ```
        
        The `serve` part is optional and can be used while making changes on the
        website.
        
        All generated artifacts can be found in the `_site/` folder.
        
        
        ## Tests
        
        To run tests, you will need `pytest`, or simply install `whotacksme` with the
        `dev` extra:
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install -e '.[dev]'
        $ pytest
        ```
