Description: Deploy Dask on Job Queueing systems
        ===================================
        
        This helps to deploy Dask on batch-style job schedulers like PBS and SLURM.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           from dask_jobqueue import PBSCluster
        
           cluster = PBSCluster(processes=6, threads=4, memory="16GB")
           cluster.start_workers(10)
        
           from dask.distributed import Client
           client = Client(cluster)
        
        Adaptivity
        ----------
        
        This can also adapt the cluster size dynamically based on current load.
        This helps to scale up the cluster when necessary but scale it down and save
        resources when not actively computing.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           cluster.adapt()
