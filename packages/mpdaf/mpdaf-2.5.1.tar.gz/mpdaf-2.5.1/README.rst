MPDAF, the *MUSE Python Data Analysis Framework*, is an open-source (BSD
licensed) Python package, developed and maintained by `CRAL
<https://cral.univ-lyon1.fr/>`_ and partially funded by the ERC advanced grant 339659-MUSICOS
(see `Authors and Credits <http://mpdaf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/credits.html>`_ for more details).

It has been developed and used in the `MUSE
Consortium <http://muse-vlt.eu/science/>`_ for several years, and is now
available freely for the community.

It provides tools to work with MUSE-specific data (raw data, pixel tables,
etc.), and with more general data like spectra, images and data cubes. Although
its main use is to work with MUSE data, it is also possible to use it other
data, for example HST images. MPDAF also provides MUSELET, a SExtractor-based
tool to detect emission lines in a datacube, and a format to gather all the
information on a source in one FITS file.

Bug reports, comments, and help with development are very welcome.

MPDAF is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.3+.
