Description: # Command line playlist bookkeeping
        This project aims to wrap any command line tool that is used for playing media
        in sequence. 
        
        Suppose one is following a couple of series, one episode per day. For most
        people it may be difficult to keep track of which episodes were watched.
        
        For any folder:
        - Add a list of media files.
        - Configure any command line options for the media player.
        - Keep track of all played files.
