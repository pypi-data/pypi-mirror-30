        Overview
        --------
        
        The dropdown solution for Plone since 2007.
        
        You will get the dropdown menus for those items in global navigation that have the subitems.
        Submenus are built based on the same policy as the Site Map,
        it will show the same tree as you would get in the Site Map or navigation portlet being in appropriate section.
        
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        Dropdown menus are build based on the same policy as the Site Map,
        it will show the same tree as you would get in the Site Map or navigation portlet being in appropriate section.
        
        This means - no **private** objects for anonymous; no objects, excluded from the navigation -
        exactly the same behavior you would expect from Site Map or navigation portlet.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        As any add-ons, please follow the `official install documentation <https://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/installing_addons.html>`_.
        
        
        Tips
        ----
        
        While disabling clicking the links with children, one may want the links in the global navigation bar to be clickable nevertheless
        
        What you need is to customize the ``browser/static/dropdown.js`` file like the following:
        
        ::
        
            jQuery(function ($) {
                $('#portal-globalnav ul .noClick').click(function (e) {
                    e.preventDefault();
                });
            });
        
        Note that we have added **ul** in the jQuery selector. This will stop
        clickability of the links in the dropdowns only, but not the section's link
        in the global navigation bar itself.

          [spliter]
        
        - Fixed the INavigationRoot treatment by the dropdown menus.
          Fixes
          https://github.com/mishunov/webcouturier.dropdownmenu/pull/3 and
          https://github.com/mishunov/webcouturier.dropdownmenu/issues/1
          [spliter]
        
        - Add dropdowmenu layer to all themes.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Added enable_parent_clickable option in config panel.  The default

          [davisagli]

          [macagua]
        
        2.0 (2009-05-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Updated README.txt with the whole bunch of information that
          users need about the package.
          [spliter]
        
        - Icon for the package's configlet link.
          [spliter]
        
        - Added configlet for managing dropdown settings rom Plone
          Control panel.
          [spliter]
        
        - Added caching feature for output xhtml.
          [spliter]
        
        - Fixed an IE Javascript error when dropdown.js was loaded on

          [davisagli]
        
        1.1.5 (2008-04-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Made the package work in both Plone 3.0.x and Plone 3.1
          [spliter]
        
        - Got rid of buggy default skin's resetting in package's profile
          [spliter]
        
        - Look for 'path' in the global tabs data, if it's available then
          it's used to get the object instead of trying to reconstruct it
          from the url which fails in many cases.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Got rid of hardcoded version of plone.browserlayer. It's up to
          users now to decide what version of plone.browserlayer to use.
          [spliter]
        
        1.1.4 (2008-04-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed the bug when you have could get the error in case your navigation
          root differs from site root. In this case you could get
          "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'endswith'" error
          [spliter]
        
        1.1.3 (2008-04-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Switched the package from using browser resource for the main
          stylesheet. It's now in skins/ to follow main theme's colors
          better
          [spliter]
        
        - Added a workaround for objects that contain spaces in their ID's
          [spliter]
        
        - Fixed the problem with images in the site's root
          [spliter]
        
        - Only override the depth for navtree queries for the dropdown menus.
          The override for the path was a nop for the common case but would
          break for sites with a different navigation root.
          [wichert]
        
        - Call constructor for base class in our DropdownMenuViewlet class. This
          removes some boilerplate code and makes sure everything is initialised
          properly.
          [wichert]
        
        1.1 (2007-10-29)
        ----------------
        
        - Dropdownmenu uses it's own builder now (instead of sharing the same one
          with site map). Implemented new property ``dropdownDepth`` to contain
          depth property for dropdown menu separately from ``sitemapDepth``.
          [spliter]
        
        - Fixed the problem with installation in Plone 3.0.2 because of relations
          with webstats.js file
          [spliter]
        
        
        1.0 (2007-10-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release. Tested in all modern browsers, incl. Safari, IE6, IE7
          and so on.
