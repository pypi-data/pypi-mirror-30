All dbc files will be placed in this module.

ICE - Intel Evt CAN

The most current version of the intel DBC should be named ICE.

Now several things to consider before finalizing the package.

Should we use package versioning to map differences in DBC files, resorting to only
having one IEC file per package OR

Keep a list of dbc-files and there versions in one package and only use package versioning
to recognize change in the codebase?


Future considerations
