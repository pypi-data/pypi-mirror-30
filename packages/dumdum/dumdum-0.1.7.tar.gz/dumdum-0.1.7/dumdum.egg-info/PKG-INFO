        Usage
        ===============
        ``dumdum`` is both a command-line utility and a library. It takes a simple
        _stanza_ format and generates a web server with endpoints from that. E.g. to do
        "hello world" you could do
        
        ::
        
            printf "
            > GET
            > /hello
            < body world
            .
            " | dumdum
        
        Then you can test with
        
        ::
        
            % curl http://localhost:8001/hello
        
            > GET /hello HTTP/1.1
            > Host: localhost:8001
            > User-Agent: curl/7.51.0
            > Accept: */*
            >
            * HTTP 1.0, assume close after body
            < HTTP/1.0 200 OK
            < Date: Wed, 17 May 2017 18:43:39 GMT
            < Server: WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.7.13
            < Content-type: text/plain
            < Content-Length: 7
        
            world
        
        This will create a server listening on the default port (``8001``). ``Dumdum`` is a
        WSGI compliant library, so you can easily serve it from your own code like
        
        ::
        
            from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
            from dumdum import Dumdum
        
            dum = Dumdum("""
            > GET
            > /hello
            < body world
            .
            """)
            srv = make_server('', 5000, dum.server)
            srv.serve_forever()
