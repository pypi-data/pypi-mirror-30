HTTPolice is a **validator or “linter” for HTTP requests and responses**.
It can spot bad header syntax, inappropriate status codes, and other potential
problems in your HTTP server or client.

See `example report`__.

__ http://httpolice.readthedocs.io/page/showcase.html

As a command-line tool, it can read `HAR files`__ or raw HTTP/1.x TCP streams.
It can integrate with `mitmproxy`__ for TLS-encrypted and HTTP/2 traffic.
Or you can use it as a Python library (for Python 2.7 and 3.4+),
with optional `Django`__ integration.
There is also a third-party `Chrome extension`__.

Start with the `quickstart`__.

A full `user manual`__ is available.
Also, a `list of all problems`__ HTTPolice can detect.

HTTPolice was partly inspired by `REDbot`__, another QA tool for the Web.
But the approach is different: instead of actively testing your server,
HTTPolice just analyzes anything you feed into it.
Thus, it can be used on requests and responses captured
from a real process or test suite.
