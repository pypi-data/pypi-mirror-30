The config `yaml` file is used to specify additional configuration for the data set update. It can be set up to either specify the fully qualified path to a `.csv.`, `.tsv` or `.xlsx` file to upload using the `path` property *or* the `directory` property can be used to upload the latest file in a directory location.

# The type of data set. This needs to be set to 'file'
dataset_type: file
# Config for the file data set type
file_config:
# Path to the dataset file
    path: 
# Or path to a directory that contains data files.
# Only the latest file that matches the accepted extensions (.csv, .tsv, .xlsx)
# will be uploaded. This is useful for creating collections based on
