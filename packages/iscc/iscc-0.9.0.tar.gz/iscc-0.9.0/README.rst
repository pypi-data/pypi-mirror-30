The **International Standard Content Code** is an `open standard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard>`_ for decentralized content identifiers. This repository contains the specification of the **ISCC Standard** and a  reference implementation in Python3. The latest published version of the specification can be found at `iscc.codes <http://iscc.codes>`_


Installing the reference code
=============================

**Windows Notes**:

The reference implamentation requires the ``xxhash`` package. Windows users
may first want to install the `xxhash binary wheel <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#xxhash>`_ to skip the required compilation step.

The reference code is published with the package name `iscc <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/iscc>`_ on Python Package Index. Install it with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install iscc


Working with the specification
==============================

The entire **ISCC Specification** is written in plain text `Markdown <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_. The markdown content is than built and published with the excellent `mkdocs <http://www.mkdocs.org/>`_ documetation tool. If you have some basic command line skills you can build and run the specification site on your own computer. Make sure you have the `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ and `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ installed on your system and follow these steps on the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/coblo/iscc-specs.git
    cd iscc-specs
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    mkdocs serve


Usage
=====

All specification documents can be found in the ``./docs`` subfolder or the repository. The recommended editor for the markdown files is `typora <https://typora.io/>`_. If you have commit rights to the `main repository <https://github.com/coblo/iscc-specs>`_ you can deploy the site with a simple ``mkdocs gh-deploy``.
