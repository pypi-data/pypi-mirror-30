Description: Shatter
        =============
        
        Data driven programming; input data and output nice functional code ;)
        
        
        Introduction
        =============
        
        This is a [python 3.6+ project](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/shatter) that uses algorithms to transform a set of
        conditions into functional python code. See some [examples](https://github.com/jisazaTappsi/shatter/tree/master/examples).
        
        
        Package Setup
        -------------
        
        Install:
        
                $ pip install shatter
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
            pyeda==0.28.0
            pandas==0.19.1
            sympy==1.1
            Keras==2.0.6
            numpy==1.13.1
            pip==9.0.1
            scikit_learn==0.19.0
        
        
        Examples
        =============
        
        
        Get Started
        -------------
        Copy paste this snippet:
        
            from shatter.solver import Rules
        
        
            def my_func(a, b):
                pass
            
            r = Rules(a=True, b=True, output=True)
            r.solve(my_func)
        
        Run it and see how `my_func` code changes from `pass` to `return a and b`. We just
        specified that when `a` and `b` are true then the output should be `True`, that is equivalent to the
        logical `and` operator.
        
        We can add further conditions and `shatter` will compute the optimal function to get there.
        
        
        Adding more conditions
        -------------
        
        Now we add 2 additional conditions with `r.add()`:
        
            from shatter.solver import Rules
        
        
            def my_func(a, b):
                pass
            
            
            r = Rules(a=True, b=True, output=True)
            r.add(a=False, b=True, output=True)
            r.add(a=True, b=False, output=True)
            r.solve(my_func)
        
        In this case the solution is `a or b`.
        
        
        If conditionals
        -------------
        
        What if the output for a given logical condition is not a boolean? In that case a programmer would use an if.
        In the next example this package solves this case:
        
        Change output to `1`:
        
            from shatter.solver import Rules
        
        
            def my_func(a, b):
                pass
            
            r = Rules(a=True, b=True, output=1)
            r.solve(my_func)
        
        
        The solution will be:
        
            def my_func(a, b):
        
                if a and b:
                    return 1
            
                return False
        
        Returns `1` or `False` otherwise.
        
        
        Adding pieces of code
        -------------
        
        Say you want to add a arbitrary piece of code that evaluates to boolean, then:
        
            from shatter.solver import Rules, Code
        
        
            def any_code(a):
                pass
            
            r = Rules(condition=Code(code_str='isinstance(a, str)'), output=2)
            r.solve(any_code)
        
        The result should be:
        
            def internal_code(a):
            
                if isinstance(a, str):
                    return 2
            
                return False
        
        Here the piece of code `isinstance(a, str)` was added as the if condition to output `2`
        
        
        Iteration
        -------------
        
        Run this code:
        
            from shatter.solver import Rules, Code, Output
        
        
            def recursive(a):
                pass
            
            a = Code()
            args = {'a': a + 1}
            out = Output(function=recursive, arguments=args)
            
            r = Rules(stopping_condition=  a > 2, output=a, default=out)
            solution = r.solve(recursive)
        
        The result this time will be a recursive counting function :)
        
            def recursive(a):
        
                if a > 2:
                    return a
            
                return recursive(a + 1)
        
        With `a = Code()` variable `a` is initialized as a code piece. Then with
        
            args = {'a': a + 1}
        
        A dictionary for the inputs of the `recursive` function is declared. Those inputs are fed into a `Output` object:
        
            out = Output(function=recursive, arguments=args)
        
        After `out` is passed via `default` keyword when initializing the `Rules` object. This `default` keyword 
        is used to override the last return statement of the `recursive` function.
        
        
        Solve Small ML problem
        ----------------------
        
        Copy paste this snippet:
        
            import pandas as pd
            from sklearn import datasets
            from shatter.solver import Rules, solve
        
        
            @solve()
            def solve_iris(x1, x2, x3, x4):
                pass
        
        
            iris = datasets.load_iris()
        
            x = iris.data
            y = iris.target
        
            data_frame = pd.DataFrame(x, columns=['x1', 'x2', 'x3', 'x4'])
        
            # Make binary and add to df
            data_frame['output'] = [int(bool(e)) for e in y]
        
        
            print(data_frame)
        
            r = Rules(data_frame)
        
            solution = r.solve(solve_iris)
        
        
        Outputs:
        
            def solve_iris():
                return x3 >= 2.45

        Setup
        -------------
        
        Clone repository:
        
            `git clone git@github.com:jisazaTappsi/shatter.git`
        
        More examples
        -------------
        
        See [examples](https://github.com/jisazaTappsi/shatter/tree/master/examples).
        
        
        How does shatter work?
        -------------
        
        Takes a function and a truth table which is processed using the
        [Quine-McCluskey Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm).
        Then finds an optimal boolean expression. This expression is inserted in the method definition.
        
        
        Rules Class
        =============
        
        Is initialized with one rule. Other rules can be added with `Rules.add()` method. To generate
        the solution call `Rules.solve()` method.
        
        Each rule
        -------------
        
        The arguments of each rule are specified as optional arguments inside a `Rules` constructor or inside a
        `Rules.add()` call. There are reserved keywords:
        
        `output`: Determines the value to be returned when the given condition is True.
        
        `output_args`: Dictionary with the values for the arguments when output is a function.
         
        `default`: Value returned when non of the rules are True.
        
        
        Arguments of `Rules.solve()`
        -------------
        
         - `function`: passed as a callable. This function is going to be filled with the solution to the present task.
         
         - `unittest=None`: Test Case to be able to run and test the code generated each time the test runs.
        See [example](https://github.com/jisazaTappsi/shatter/tree/master/examples/with_tests) for a deeper understanding.
        
        
        Output Class
        -------------
        
        `solver.Output`: Class that helps define a function with arguments as an output. Has fields:
          
          - `function`: A callable object.
          - `arguments` Dictionary with the function inputs.
        
        Code class
        -------------
        
        `solver.Code`: Class that helps represent pieces of code. The code is fed as a string (with optional argument `str_code`)
        or it can be declared as variables. eg:
        
            from shatter.solver import Code
            
            a = Code()
            b = Code()
            print(a > b)
        
        This will literally print the code `a > b` rather than the objects or any result.
        
        
        Solution class
        -------------
        
        `solver.Solution`: Class that contains the solution of the problem it includes:
            
          - `rules`: The information given by the user.
          - `implementation`: Plain code.
          - `ast`: Abstract syntax tree
