Description: splitnjoin
        ==========
        
        Simple module for splitting files into multiple chunks/parts and
        viceversa (from chunks/parts to original file).
        
        I made splitnjoin for 3 reasons: 1. Speed-up uploading sessions (it is
        better to upload small, multiple files instead of a larger one; in case
        of network failure some parts of file are already online) 2. Surpass ISP
        *not-nice* upload limitations about filesizes 3. End the laziness of a
        boring sunday
        
        Performance of splitting/joining phases can vary greatly **depending on
        hardware configuration** (especially the HDD speed).
        
        For instance, let's try to split a Virtual Box virtual machine sized
        8.5+ GB (.vdi): - A system equipped with AMD Ryzen 7, 16 GB DDR4 and an
        SSD.MD can split the VM in 34 chunks of 250MB each one, in less than 20
        seconds - An older notebook (i3, 8GB DDR3, and 5400 RPM HDD) requires 4+
        minutes to split it with the same parameters
        
        To read benchmark and performance tests, read sections below
        ("Perfomance tests").
        
        Important: **don't use splitnjoin in production enviroments**, of
        course.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        A default Python3 installation. It works on every Linux distro and every
        Windows version.
        
        About **hardware requirements**: splitting and joining huge files are
        **CPU/RAM intensive tasks** and 'splitnjoin' is currently in its early
        days so don't expect big updates regarding resource optmization soon (I
        am working on it, that's for sure).
        
        To put it simple: if you have a system with a fairly capable CPU and 4/8
        GB RAM you shouldn't have any problem splitting huge files (for example,
        8+ GB on hard disk).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/>`__
        
        ``pip3 install splitnjoin``
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        **Splitting by chunk size example**
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import splitnjoin as snj
            import os
            import sys
        
            fsplitter = snj.FileProcessor()
        
            #Set size of each chunk, for example: 25 mb
            p_size = 25
        
            #File to split and subdir where to save chunks
            from_file = "myFile.ext"
            to_dir = "splitting_dir"
        
            absfrom, absto = map(os.path.abspath, [from_file, to_dir])
            print('Splitting', absfrom, 'to', absto, 'by', p_size, 'mb...')
            #Split now
            fsplitter.split_file(from_file, p_size, to_dir)
        
        **Splitting by parts example**
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import splitnjoin as snj
            import os
            import sys
        
            fsplitter = snj.FileProcessor()
        
            #Set the number of parts you want, for example: 10
            p_num = 10
        
            #File to split and subdir where to save parts
            from_file = "myFile.ext"
            to_dir = "splitting_dir"
        
            absfrom, absto = map(os.path.abspath, [from_file, to_dir])
            print('Splitting', absfrom, 'to', absto, 'in', p_num, 'parts...')
            #Split now
            fsplitter.split_file_by_parts(from_file, p_num, to_dir)
        
        **Joining example**
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import splitnjoin as snj
            import os
            import sys
        
            fjoiner = snj.FileProcessor()
        
            #Set the size-value for reading chunks, for example: 25 mb
            readsize = 25
        
            #Set chunks dir and dest filename
            from_dir = "splitting_dir"
            to_file = "joined_myFile.ext"
        
            absfrom, absto = map(os.path.abspath, [from_dir, to_file])
            print('Joining', absfrom, 'to', absto, 'by', readsize)
            #Join now
            fjoiner.join_file(from_dir, readsize, to_file)
        
        Performance tests
        -----------------
        
        I made a simple testing and benchmarking tool (splitting a binary file
        into chunks of 250MB each one).
        
        Run it like this: ``python3 -m splitnjoin.snj_benchmark.py``.
        
        On my notebook (Intel i3 dual core, 8 GB RAM, 500 GB 5400 RPM disk,
        Linux Mint 18.3) this is the output:
