I got the name of the game, and setting up a github repo for it.

Jules Verne is awesome. It's one of the first books I read as a child.

Also, I remember typing up a balloon game on c64 when I was little too.

So this is a little bit nostalgic for me. But also, I like the setting.

Next up, I'll set up my base code. Probably should have done this earlier.

This is what I hate about python... config file soup.
Note to self: finish pyrelease.

But, I'll at least use pipenv. Warm, happy pipenv.

For my Two Worlds pyweek... I'm thinking of doing a split screen game. Where you control the avatar in both worlds. So your input has to avoid collisions in both. Controlling the hot air that goes into a balloon to make it rise. Just obstacle avoidance I guess, but sort of interesting because you have to do it in two Worlds at once.

I'm using pygame and will also try a bunch of libraries.

Probably 'thorpy' for game menus/gui, and 'transitions' for state machines.
