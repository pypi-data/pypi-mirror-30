`Snips NLU <https://snips-nlu.readthedocs.io>`_ (Natural Language Understanding) is a Python library that allows to parse sentences written in natural language and extracts structured information.


Installing
----------

.. code-block:: python

    pip install snips-nlu

We currently have pre-built binaries (wheels) for ``snips-nlu`` and its
dependencies for MacOS and Linux x86_64. If you use a different
architecture/os you will need to build these dependencies from sources
which means you will need to install
`setuptools_rust <https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust>`_ and
`Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html>`_ before running the
``pip install snips-nlu`` command.

A simple example
----------------

Letâ€™s take an example to illustrate the main purpose of this lib, and consider the following sentence:

.. code-block:: text

    "What will be the weather in paris at 9pm?"

Properly trained, the Snips NLU engine will be able to extract structured data such as:

.. code-block:: json

    {
       "intent": {
          "intentName": "searchWeatherForecast",
          "probability": 0.95
       },
       "slots": [
          {
             "value": "paris",
             "entity": "locality",
             "slotName": "forecast_locality"
          },
          {
             "value": {
                "kind": "InstantTime",
                "value": "2018-02-08 20:00:00 +00:00"
             },
             "entity": "snips/datetime",
             "slotName": "forecast_start_datetime"
          }
       ]
    }
