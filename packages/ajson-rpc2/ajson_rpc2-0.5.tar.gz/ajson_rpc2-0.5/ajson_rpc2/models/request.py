    method:
        A String containing the name of the method to be invoked. Method names that begin with the word rpc followed by a period character (U+002E or ASCII 46) are
        reserved for rpc-internal methods and extensions and MUST NOT be used for anything else.
    params:
        A Structured value that holds the parameter values to be used during the invocation of the method. This member MAY be omitted.
    id:
        An identifier established by the Client that MUST contain a String, Number, or NULL value if included. If it is not included it is assumed to be a notification.
        The value SHOULD normally not be Null [1] and Numbers SHOULD NOT contain fractional parts.

    The Server MUST reply with the same value in the Response object if included. This member is used to correlate the context between the two objects.'''

    Notifications are not confirmable by definition, since they do not have a Response object to be returned.
    As such, the Client would not be aware of any errors (like e.g. "Invalid params","Internal rror").'''
