Pyramid List Pagination
=======================

Pyramid List Pagination contains pyramid resources and helpers for pagination
of result lists.

A lot of pyramid_ applications that use a (SQL) database need to list the result
of queries. This result list might get quite long and are split into several
pages. This package is offering some help in this.


Quickstart
----------

Lets assume, that you'd like to start a cheese shop and define a simple
database model in the pyramid application::

    from .meta import Base

    class Cheese(Base):
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        name = Column(Text, nullable=False)

To get a result list including pagination, just create a sub-class from
:class:`pyramid_listing.SQLAlchemyListing` and define a ``get_base_query``
method::

    from pyramid_listing import SQLAlchemyListing

    class CheeseList(SQLAlchemyListing):

        def get_base_query(self, request)
            return request.dbsession.query(Cheese)

In a view you could then use this class to autmagically get paged results::

    @view_config(route_name='cheeses')
    def cheese_list_view(request):
        listing = CheeseList(request)
        return {'cheeses': listing.items(), 'pagination': listing.pages}

With this URLs you could access different result pages:

    shows page 3:

    https://example.com/cheeses?p=3

    shows page 1 with 42 items per page:

    https://example.com/cheeses?p=1&n=42


Features
--------

* automatically calculate pagination information like first, next or last page
  from `pyradmid.request.GET` parameters
* loading configuration defaults from .ini files
* easily implement ordering and filtering of results
* helper method for creating `pyradmid.request.GET` parameters for different
  pages
* base class for listings as location aware pyramid resources

History
=======

0.1.8 (2018-03-18)
------------------
* changed SQLAlchemyListing.pages to a calculated property:

  Just creating a SQLAlchemyListing instance does not automatically trigger
  a database query.Â It will only execute this first query if pagination
  information is accessed, e.g. in a ordered query.


0.1.7 (2018-03-14)
------------------
* applied filters can now be accessed via ``SQLAlchemyListing.filters``


0.1.6 (2018-03-13)
------------------
* updated documentation setup for readthedocs.org


0.1.5 (2018-03-13)
------------------
* code adjustments after liniting


0.1.4 (2018-03-13)
------------------
* fixed bug where settings as strings were not parsed correctly
* changed default implementation of __getitem__() to use base_query
* changed ordered_query from a calculated property to a real one


0.1.3 (2018-03-12)
------------------

* The classes and the includeme() function are now exposed in the __init__.py
  file


0.1.2 (2018-03-12)
------------------

* The pagination calculation class can now be configured in ``Listing`` and
  ``Resource`` classes. This enables the use of different pagination defaults
  in different lists.


0.1.1 (2018-03-12)
------------------

* Untangled Pagination configuration from includeme() function. Pagination
  (sub-) classes can now be configured via the ``configure()`` method


0.1.0 (2018-03-11)
------------------

* First Working Implementation


0.0.1 (2018-03-08)
------------------

* Starting the project
