Description: tabmaker
        ========
        
        This program installs a script which generates song lyrics with chords above the correct words given a file in the correct format.
        
        Syntax:
        ```
        tabmaker in_file[ out_file]
        ```
        
        infile must be a plain text file with square brackets around the chords:
        
        ```
        [c]Twinkle, twinkle [f]little [c]star,
        [f]How I [c]wonder [g]what you [c]are.
        ```
        
        outfile is optional (defaults to the standard output) and prints the chords above the lyrics like so:
        
        ```
        c                f      c    
        Twinkle, twinkle little star,
        f     c      g        c   
        How I wonder what you are.
        ```
