# Export Zotero to a web site

This project exports your local [Zotero] library to a usable HTML website.
This generated website has the following features:

* Easily access your papers, site snapshots, notes from a navigation tree.
* Provides metadata from collections and attachments (i.e. referenes etc).
* Display PDF papers and website snapshot (the latter as framed).
* Method to navigate to/view the paper/website snapshot directly.
* Snazzy look and feel from the latest [Bootstrap] CSS/Javascript library.

## Obtaining

The easist way to install the command line program is via the `pip` installer:
```bash
pip install zotsite
```


## Usage

The program has two modes: show configuration (a good first step) and create
the web site.


### Show Structure

You can see what the program is parsing from your [Zotero] library:

```bash
zotsite print
```


### Website Creation

Run the program (without the angle brackets):

```bash
zotsite export -o <sitedir>
```

After the program runs, `sitedir` will be where the tool creates/generates the
the new site.  Note you can also give a `--datadir` to tell the program where
your [Zotero] library is.  This can also be configured in
your [configuration](#configuration-file).

The website will work as served from either a website or from the local file
system.  You can pass `levels` as a URL encoded parameter to produce the number
of levels when the page is loaded.

On the left you can click on the tree to select collections or attachments.
You have to drill all the way down to the leaf level in the tree to get at your
attachements and notes.  At the leaf level you can select and unselect a node
but all other nodes are note *selectable*.

By clicking on a non-leaf node it expands or collapses everything *and* gives
the meta data for that collection.  Note that this behavior was decided more by
the way [Tree View] works more than anything else since it is designed to show
the entire tree list at once.

### Configuration File

All command line parameters you provide can also be given in a `ini` style
configuration file, for example:

```ini
[default]
data_dir=%(HOME)s/.zotero
```

tells the program where the [Zotero] data directory is located in the user's
home directory with name `.zotero` (this defaults to the Zotero default).

You can indicate where the program configuration file is with the `ZOTSITERC`
environment variable or use the `--config` command line program.


## Process

The tool does the following:

1. Exports the meta data (directory structure, references, notes, etc) from
   your [Zotero] library.  On MacOS, this is done by querying the file system
   SQLite DB files.
2. Copies a static site that enables traversal of the exported data.
3. Copies your [Zotero] stored papers, snapshot (sites) etc.
4. Generates a navigation tree to easily find your papers/content.


### Platform

This project uses the SQLite Python library and should run on other platforms
but assumes a directory structure that's been tested on OSX.


## Attribution

This software uses:
* Python 3
* [Bootstrap] version 4
* [Tree View] for Bootstrap
* [Popper] for tooltips


## Snapshot

![Snapshot](doc/snapshot.png?raw=true "Zotero Snapshot")


## Todo

* Make the site portion a proper Javascript site.  Right now, all the `min`s
  are added in the distribution to same directory as
  the [main navigation/content](src/site/js/zotero.js) file.
* Add functionality to the disabled *View* button that drills down in a paper
  and finds a PDF or site to view withouth the user having to do this.


## Changelog

An extensive changelog is available [here](CHANGELOG.md).
