        Python package that searches a 2D grid of randomly generated letters (a-z only) for valid English words. Words can be found along any diagonal, forwards, upwards, downwards or backwards and cannot ‘wrap’ between edges. To check if a word is valid, a list of words at res/input/words.txt is used as a reference dictionary.
