# mera_photo
A python module to sort the images using facial recognition

## Why
I recently purchased a new phone with a good camera, and within no time I had 10-15 Gb worth of photo's of my friends.
Now the redundant thing I did after each of our outing's was picking the images of my friends and sending it to them.
So why not automate this entire process?

## Enter SLAC
A hanckathon called stay late and code, where I sat down and made this module.

## How to use

`pip install mera_photo`
`mera_photo path`

path - The folder in which you have the 'images' folder
        - Other folders in this path should be person1,person2 ....person_n
		Each containing 1 photo of that person. That face from that photo will be used to find
