Description: # mera_photo
        A python module to sort the images using facial recognition
        
        ## Why
        I recently purchased a new phone with a good camera, and within no time I had 10-15 Gb worth of photo's of my friends.
        Now the redundant thing I did after each of our outing was picking the images of my friends and sending it to them.
        So why not automate this entire process?
        
        ## Enter SLAC
        A hanckathon called stay late and code, where I sat down and made this module.
        
        ## How to use
        
        `pip install mera_photo`
        `mera_photo path`
        
        path - The folder in which you have the 'images' folder
                - Other folders in this path should be person1,person2 ....person_n
        		Each containing 1 photo of that person. That face from that photo will be used to find
