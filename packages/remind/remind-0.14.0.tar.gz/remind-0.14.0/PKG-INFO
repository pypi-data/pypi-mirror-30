Description: Python Remind library
        =====================
        
        Python library to convert between `Remind <https://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind>`_ and iCalendar.
        Can be used stand alone (provided rem2ics and ics2rem tools) as well as integrated as a CalDAV client or server.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You need to have the Remind command line tool installed.
        For Debian/Ubuntu use::
        
          $ sudo apt-get install remind
        
        Using pip
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
          $ pip install remind
        
        This will install all Python dependencies as well.
        
        Using python-setuptools
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
          $ python setup.py install
        
        Set up a Remind CalDAV server
        -----------------------------
        
        Have a look at `radicale-remind <https://github.com/jspricke/radicale-remind>`_
        
        Sync to an external iCalendar server (http; cron)
        -------------------------------------------------
        
        ::
        
          curl URL | ics2rem >> ~/.reminders
        
        Sync to an external CalDAV server
        ---------------------------------
        
        Have a look at `remind-caldav <https://github.com/jspricke/remind-caldav>`_
        
        Share your calendar using http
        ------------------------------
        
        ::
        
          rem2ics > /var/www/html/my.ics
        
        Publish the URL and use these guides to integrate it into other calendar software:
        
        * `Thunderbird/Lightning <https://mzl.la/1BsOArH>`_ (Section: On the Network)
        * `Google Calendar <https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100>`_
        * `Apple Calendar <https://support.apple.com/kb/PH11523>`_
        
        Format of the Remind MSG body
        -----------------------------
        
        ::
        
          %" summary at location %" description
        
        The ``%"`` is omitted, if there is no description in the iCalendar.
        
        Known limitations
        -----------------
        
        iCalendar -> Remind
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * RECURRENCE-ID is not supported at the moment. This is a limitation of the used python-vobject library, see http://lists.skyhouseconsulting.com/pipermail/vobject/2009-September/000204.html.
        
        Remind -> iCalendar
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Events are only evaluated in the given time frame, so events extending it, are cut of (birthday reminders for example).
        * Complex reminders are only preserved in their evaluated form (PUSH-OMIT-CONTEXT, OMIT, TRIGGER, BEFORE, SKIP).
        * Periodic reminders other then daily or weekly are not preserved.
