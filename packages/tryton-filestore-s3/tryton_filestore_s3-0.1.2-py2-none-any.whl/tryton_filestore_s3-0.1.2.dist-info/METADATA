Tryton FileStore S3 AWS Backend
===============================

S3 AWS backend for the Tryton application framework.

In order to configure the S3 Amazon you should modify your trytond
configuration file to include the `tryton_filestore_s3.FileStoreS3` as class
of the database section. Also you need to specify the s3 credentials
with the access_key, secret_key and bucket values.

An example configuration file looks like::

    [database]
    class=tryton_filestore_s3.FileStoreS3
    access_key=access-key-s3
    secret_key=secret-key-s3
    bucket=bucket-id-here

Once you have specified the config file, everything should work out of the
box and you should see your attachments created on the S3 bucket.
