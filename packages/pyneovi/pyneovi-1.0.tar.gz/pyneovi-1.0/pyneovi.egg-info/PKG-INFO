Description: pyneovi is a wrapper around the API provided by Intrepid Control Systems for communicating with their NeoVI range of devices.
        
        
        
        The focus of the library is on communicating with the ECU in the context of a diagnostic session. Currently, authentication via Security Access commands is not handled and must be performed by a separate tool.
