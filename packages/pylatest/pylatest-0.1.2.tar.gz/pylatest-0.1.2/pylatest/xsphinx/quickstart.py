Pylatest Quickstart module.

Quickly setup documentation source to work with Sphinx/Pylatest project.
The code extending sphinx.quickstart module is based on hierogliph.quickstart
module by Nathan Yergler (see full copyright notice below).

Note that this is a little hack (although very useful in our case), Sphinx
itself is not designed with extending quickstart tool in mind.
