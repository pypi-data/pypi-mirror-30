class TreehopperUsb:
    """
    The core class for communicating with Treehopper USB boards.

    This class represents a Treehopper board. You'll access all the pins, peripherals, and board functions through
    this object, which will automatically create all peripheral instances for you.

    Warning:
        Do not attempt to create a TreehopperUsb instance manually; always obtain references to boards from the
        treehopper.api.find_boards() function.

    Examples:
        >>> board = find_boards()[0]        # Get the first board.
        >>> board.connect()                 # Be sure to connect before doing anything else.
        >>> board.led = True                # Turn on the board's LED.
        >>> imu = Mpu9250.probe(board.i2c)  # Connect an MPU9250 9-DoF IMU to the I2C interface on the board.
        >>> print(imu.accelerometer)        # Print the acceleration reading from the sensor.
        '[0.95, 0.01, 0.03]'
        >>> board.disconnect()              # Disconnect from the board when finished.

    Attributes:
        pins (list[DigitalPin]): Collection of pins that belong to this board (List[Pin.Pin]).
        spi (HardwareSpi): The SPI peripheral (HardwareSpi.HardwareSpi).
        i2c (HardwareI2c): The I2C peripheral (HardwareI2c.HardwareI2c).
        uart (HardwareUart): The UART peripheral (HardwareUart.HardwareUart).
        pwm1 (HardwarePwm): The PWM1 peripheral (HardwarePwm.HardwarePwm).
        pwm2 (HardwarePwm): The PWM2 peripheral (HardwarePwm.HardwarePwm).
        pwm3 (HardwarePwm): The PWM3 peripheral (HardwarePwm.HardwarePwm).
        hardware_pwm_manager (HardwarePwmManager): The hardware PWM manager (HardwarePwmManager.HardwarePwmManager).
