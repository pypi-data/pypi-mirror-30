Captured log messages are added to the ``<system-out>`` tag in the generated junit xml file if the ``junit_logging`` ini option is set to ``system-out``. If the value of this ini option is ``system-err`, the logs are written to ``<system-err>``. The default value for ``junit_logging`` is ``no``, meaning captured logs are not written to the output file.
