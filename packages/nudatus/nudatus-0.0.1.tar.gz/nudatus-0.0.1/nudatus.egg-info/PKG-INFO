Description: Nudatus
        =======
        
        Nudatus is a tool to remove comments from python scripts
        
        It's created for use in uflash_ to help squeeze longer programs onto the micro:bit but it should be suitable for various environments with restricted storage
        
        *Note* Nudatus uses the tokenizer built into Python so only supports the syntax of the version it's running on but it's extreamly unlikly this will cause you any issues (print is handled fine)
        
        Usage
        --------
        
        Nudatus is designed to be embedded within a greater tool (like uflash_ or Mu_ by ntoll_) but also provides a CLI tool
        
        
        .. code:: text
        
            nudatus [-h] [--version] [input] [output]
        
        
        An input file must be specified but if output is omitted the result will be printed on stdout
        
        Calling from a Python script is quite simple:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import nudatus
            source = '' # Input script
            result = nudatus.mangle(source) # Result as str

        .. _Mu: http://codewith.mu/
