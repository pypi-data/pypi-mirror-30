Write boilerplate-free Python functions and use them as your API handlers.
Sticker allows you to choose Flask, bottle.py, Sanic, or Tornado as your
application runtime.

**Highlights**:

* Community created and maintained
* Support for `OpenAPI 3.0 <https://swagger.io/specification/>`_
* Multi-framework support: `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_, `bottle.py <https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle>`_, `Sanic <https://github.com/channelcat/sanic>`_, and `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/>`_
* Support for **pure Python handlers** (no boilerplate code)

It's Easy to Write
==================

You need a little bit of Python.

.. code-block:: python

    # filename: hello.py

    def say_hello(params):
        return {"contents": "Hello World!"}

Plus bits of your API description.

.. code-block:: YAML

    # filename: hello.yml
    openapi: "3.0.0"
    paths:
      /:
        get:
          operationId: hello.say_hello

Now the fun part, you choose which web framework you want to use.

Run with Flask:

.. code-block:: python

    from sticker import FlaskAPI
    api = FlaskAPI('hello.yml')
    api.get_app(__name__).run()

Run with Bottle.py:

.. code-block:: python

    from sticker import BottleAPI
    api = BottleAPI('hello.yml')
    api.run()

Run with Sanic:

.. code-block:: python

    from sticker import SanicAPI
    api = SanicAPI('hello.yml')
    api.get_app(__name__).run()

Run with Tornado:

.. code-block:: python

    from sticker import TornadoAPI
    import tornado.ioloop
    api = TornadoAPI('hello.yml')
    api.get_app().listen(8888)
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().start()

The framework setup, validation, types conversion, and mocking is handled at runtime by Sticker.

Installation
============

Sticker is published at PyPI, so you can use `pip` to install:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install sticker

Requirements
============

Sticker was developed for __Python >=3.6__ and __OpenAPI 3.0__. Support for Python 2.7 is not present nor planned for this project.

Documentation
=============

Sticker is a flexible metaframework for Web API development and execution. The OpenAPI 3.0 standard is used as
description format for Sticker powered APIs. You provide the API specification and choose one of the
Sticker's runtimes to have a webserver up and running.

In this document we will describe a few different ways to write code that works well with Sticker.

Pure Python Handlers
--------------------

Sticker supports the use of pure Python functions as handlers. Your code will be free of any framework
specific boilerplate code, including Sticker's itself. This allows you to swap between different frameworks
as you wish. Sticker will take care of putting together your code, your API, and the framework you choose.

.. code-block:: python

    def myhandler(params):
        return {
            "content": f"Hello {params.get("name", "World")}!",
            "status": 200
        }

Writing tests for pure Python handles is easy and also
free of boilerplate code.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_myhandler():
        params = {
            "name": "John Doe"
        }
        response = myhandler(params)
        assert response["content"] == "Hello John Doe!"

As you could see in the example above, no imports from Sticker were necessary to define the API handler function.
This is only possible because Sticker expects your handlers to follow a code convention.

Anatomy Of An API Handler Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Write this part.

Responses
^^^^^^^^^

API handlers are expected to return a Python dictionary (`dict`) object. The returned dictionary defines how a response
will look like. All keys in the dictionary are optional. The expected keys are described in the table bellow.

=========== ======================== ===========
Key         Type                     Description
=========== ======================== ===========
content     str                      Body of HTTP request. No treatment/parsing of this value is done. The value is passed directly to the chosen framework.
json        Union[dict, List[dict]]  JSON value to be used in the body of the request. This is a shortcut to having the header "Content-Type: application/json" and serializing this value using the most common way done by the chosen framework.
file        Union[IO[AnyStr], str]   Data to be returned as byte stream. This is a shortcut for having the header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream". Uses the most common way to stream files with the chosen framework.
redirect    str                      The path or full URL to be redirected. This is a shortcut for having the header "Location:" with HTTP status `301`.
status      int                      The HTTP status code to be used in the response. This value overrides any shortcut default status code.
headers     Dict[str, str]           The HTTP headers to be used in the response. This value is merged with the shortcut values with priority.
=========== ======================== ===========


We have exposed here some examples of using different configurations of the `dict` we've defined above to describe the
HTTP response of API handlers. The actual HTTP response value generated will vary depending on the framework chosen as
runtime. The examples are a minimal illustration of what to expect to be the HTTP response.

The "content" key can be used when it's desired to return a "Hello world!" string with status `200`.

.. code-block:: python

    def say_hello(params):
        return {"content": "Hello world!"}

Results in the HTTP response similar to:

.. code-block::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/plain

    Hello world!

The "json" key can be used when desired to return an JSON response with status `201`.

.. code-block:: python

    def create(params):
        data = {
            "id": "uhHuehuE",
            "value": "something"
        }
        return {"json": data, "status": 201}

The HTTP response generated will be similar to:

.. code-block::

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Content-Type: application/json

    {"id":"uhHuehuE","value":"something"}

The "file" key is used to return file contents.

.. code-block:: python

    def homepage(params):
        return {
            "file": open('templates/home.html', 'r'),
            "headers": {
                "Content-Type": "text/html"
            }
        }

The HTTP response will be similar to:

.. code-block::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html

    <html><title>My homepage</title><body><h1>Welcome!</h1></body></html>

When necessary to redirect request, the "redirect" key can be used.

.. code-block:: python

    def old_endpoint(params):
        return {'redirect': '/new-path'}

The HTTP response will be similar to:

.. code-block::

    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    Location: https://example.com/new-path

The usage of keys "status" and "headers" were shown in the previous examples. The "status" and "headers" keys, when set,
override the values set by default when using the shortcut keys ("json", "file", and "redirect").

Error Handling
--------------

Sticker expects you to define the error format to be returned by your API. A error handler is configurable,
and called every time validation for the endpoint fails.

.. code-block:: python

    def error_handler(error):
        return {
            "content": {
                "error": error["message"]
            },
            "headers": {
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            "status_code": 400
        }
