# oathguardian: one-time password (TOTP/HOTP) generator


Oathguardian is a GTK-3 graphical tool for generating
[Time-based one-time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm)
as defined in [RFC6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238). Those one-time passwords are frequently
used as a two-factory authentication mechanism, by using a smartphone application such as 
[Google authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator).

Oathguardian permits to store the key secret either in a
[secret service](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service) such as Gnome Keyring ; or into a
[Yubikey 4](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4/). The yubikey is an USB device that has many
security-related usages, such as storing a PGP private key, or doing TOTP/HOTP computations.
