        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 0.5.5
        -------------
        
        Released on April 5, 2018.
        
        - Added missing equality functions (i.e., ``==``, ``!=`` operators, & ``hash()``
          function) to ``nirum.datastructures.Map`` and ``nirum.datastructures.List``.
          [`#110`_]
        
        .. _#110: https://github.com/spoqa/nirum-python/issues/110
        
        
        Version 0.5.4
        -------------
        
        Released on December 9, 2017.
        
        - Made ``nirum.datastructures.List`` to copy the given value so that
          it doesn't refer given value's state and is immutable.
        
        
        Version 0.5.3
        -------------
        
        Released on July 6, 2017.
        
        - Fixed a serialization bug that other set-like (i.e. ``collections.Set``) types
          than Python built-in ``set`` hadn't been reduced to simpler forms so that they
          can be encoded to JSON.
        - Fixed a serialization bug that other list-like (i.e. ``collections.Sequence``)
          types than Python built-in ``list`` hadn't been reduced to simpler forms so
          that they can be encoded to JSON.
        
        
        Version 0.5.2
        -------------
        
        Released on June 23, 2017.
        
        - ``url`` of ``nirum.rpc.Client`` and
          ``method`` of ``nirum.rpc.Client.make_request``
          now can be both ``unicode`` and ``str`` on Python 2.7. [`#87`_]
        - ``nirum.rpc.Client`` had been an old-style class on Python 2, but now
          it became a new-style class also on Python 2. (As Python 3 has only new-style
          class, there's no change on Python 3.)
        
        .. _#87: https://github.com/spoqa/nirum-python/pull/87
        
        
        Version 0.5.1
        -------------
        
        Released on June 22, 2017.
        
        - Added Python 3.6 support.
        - Fixed a bug that service client methods hadn't raised the proper error
          type but ``nirum.exc.UnexpectedNirumResponseError`` instead.  [`#71`_]
        - Wheel distributions (``nirum-*.whl``) are now universal between Python 2
          and 3.  [`#78`_]
        - ``nirum.rpc.Service`` had been an old-style class on Python 2, but now
          it became a new-style class also on Python 2.  (As Python 3 has only new-style
          class, there's no change on Python 3.)  [`#83`_]
        - ``nirum.rpc.Client`` and its subtype became to raise ``TypeError`` with
          a better error message when its ``make_request()`` method is overridden and
          it returns a wrong artity of tuple.  [`#80`_]
        - ``nirum.rpc.WsgiApp`` and its subtype became to raise ``TypeError`` with
          a better error message when its ``make_response()`` method is overridden and
          it returns a wrong artity of tuple.  [`#80`_]
        - Fixed a bug that ``Client.ping()`` method had always raised ``TypeError``.
          [`#80`_]
        - Corrected a typo ``Accepts`` on request headers ``Client`` makes to
          ``Accept``.

        Version 0.5.0
        -------------
        
        Released on June 1, 2017.
        
        - Service methods became able to specify its error type. [`#71`_]
        - Added ``nirum-server`` command to run simply Nirum service.

        - Added missing equality functions (i.e., ``==``, ``!=`` operators, & ``hash()``
          function) to ``nirum.datastructures.Map`` and ``nirum.datastructures.List``.

        Version 0.4.2
        -------------
        
        Released on July 6, 2017.
        
        - Fixed a serialization bug that other set-like (i.e. ``collections.Set``) types
          than Python built-in ``set`` hadn't been reduced to simpler forms so that they
          can be encoded to JSON.

        Version 0.4.1
        -------------
        
        Released on May 2, 2017.
        
        - Compare type with its abstract type in ``nirum.validate.validate_type``.
        
        
        Version 0.4.0
        -------------
        
        Released on March 20, 2017.
        
        - Encoding of map types was changed according to the `Nirum serialization
          specification`__.  [`#66`_]
        - Added ``nirum.datastructures`` module and ``nirum.datastructures.Map``
          which is an immutable dictionary.  [`#66`_]
        - Added ``nirum.datastructures.List`` which is an immutable list.
          [`#49`_]
        - Aliased ``nirum.datastructures.Map`` as ``map_type``, and
          ``nirum.datastructures.List`` as ``list_type`` to avoid name
          conflict with user-defined types.
