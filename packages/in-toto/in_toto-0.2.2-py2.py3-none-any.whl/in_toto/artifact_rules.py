def unpack_rule(rule):
  """
  Parses the rule and extracts and returns the necessary data to apply the
  rule. Can also be used to verify if a rule complies with any of the formats

  <Arguments>
    rule:
        The rule to be unpacked, one of:
        MATCH <pattern> [IN <source-path-prefix>] WITH (MATERIALS|PRODUCTS)
            [IN <destination-path-prefix>] FROM <step>,
        CREATE <path,
        DELETE <pattern>,
        MODIFY <pattern>,
        ALLOW <pattern>,
        DISALLOW <pattern>

  <Exceptions>
    raises FormatError, if the rule does not comply with any of the formats.

  <Side Effects>
    None.

  <Returns>
    A dictionary of the artifact rule data,
    if it is a generic rule the dictionary is:
    {
      "type": rule[0], i.e.: ("CREATE"|"MODIFY"|"DELETE"|"ALLOW"|"DISALLOW")
      "pattern" : rule[1], i.e. path pattern
    }

    if it is a match rule, the dictionary is:
    {
      "type": rule[0], i.e. "MATCH",
      "pattern": rule[1], i.e. path pattern
      "source_prefix": path or empty string
      "dest_prefix": path or empty string
      "dest_type" : destination artifact type, ("MATERIAL"|"PRODUCT")
