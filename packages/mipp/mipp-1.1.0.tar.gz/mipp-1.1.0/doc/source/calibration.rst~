MSG series
==========


The calibration of the meteosat second generation satellites is done according to the Eumetsat documents.

Reflectances
------------

The visible and near infrared channels are calibrated according to the following formula:

r = R / I

where 
 * r is the bidirectional reflectance factor
 * R is the measured radiance
 * I is the solar irradiance

R is derived from the xRIT data, and I is given in [refl]_
