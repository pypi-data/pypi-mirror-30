## Setec Astronomy

Simple, fast, compact encryption and signing.

Based on modern cryptography courtesy of PyNaCl.

__EXPERIMENTAL__: Use at your own risk. While the
underlying cryptography has been well-studied,
many security vulnerabilities arise from implementation
bugs. The setec code is fairly simple, but has
not been fully tested, so no security guarantees
are provided by the project authors, either implicit
or otherwise.

Requires Python 3.5 or better.
