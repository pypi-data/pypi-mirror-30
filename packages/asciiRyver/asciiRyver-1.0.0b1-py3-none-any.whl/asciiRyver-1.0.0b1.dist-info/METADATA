asciiRyver
==========

asciiRyver is a `Ryver`_ chat client designed to be able to run in the terminal. This was built on the `Asciimatics`_ framework. This is not designed to be professional software, and it is still currently in beta. At present, there may be lots of bugs encountered, but the basic chat functionality is working, including: forums, workgroups, direct messaging, topics, and topic creation.
