Description: em: the cli emoji keyboard‚Ñ¢
        ===========================
        
        **Emoji your friends and colleagues from the comfort of your own terminal.**
        
        **em** is a nifty command-line utility for referencing emoji characters
        by name. Provide the names of a few emoji, and those lucky chosen emojis
        will be displayed in your terminal, then copied to your clipboard.
        Automagically.
        
        Emoji can be also searched by both categories and aspects.

        Example Usage
        -------------
        
        Let's serve some delicious cake::
        
            $ em sparkles cake sparkles
            Copied! ‚ú®üç∞‚ú®
        
        
        Let's skip the copying (for scripts)::
        
            $ em 'chocolate bar' --no-copy
            üç´
        
        Let's find some emoji, by color::
        
            $ em -s red
            üöó  car
            üé¥  flower_playing_cards
            üëπ  japanese_ogre
            üë∫  japanese_goblin
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        At this time, **em** requires Python and pip::
        
            $ pip install em-keyboard-py3
        
        That's it!
        
        
        Have fun!

        Why This Repo and Not The Original?
        -----------------------------------
        Python 3 support has been broken for almost 2 years.  It's been fixed in the repo but for some reason a new version haven't been released for it.  This is to fill the gap; should `em` get updated this will go away.
