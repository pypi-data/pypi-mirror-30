        Introduction
        ============
        
        This is **version 1.12.5 of PyMuPDF**, a Python binding for `MuPDF <http://mupdf.com/>`_ - "a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer".
        
        MuPDF can access files in PDF, XPS, OpenXPS, epub, comic and fiction book formats, and it is known for its top performance and high rendering quality.
        
        With PyMuPDF you therefore can also access files with extensions ``*.pdf``, ``*.xps``, ``*.oxps``, ``*.epub``, ``*.cbz`` or ``*.fb2`` from your Python scripts.
        
        PyMuPDF should run on all platforms that are supported by both, MuPDF and Python. These include, but are not limited to, Windows (XP SP2 and up), Mac OS and Linux, 32-bit or 64-bit. If you can generate MuPDF on a Python supported platform, then also PyMuPDF can be used there.
        
        PyMuPDF is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF>`_ where you find up-to-date information of its features, our `issue tracker <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/issues>`_, `Wikis <https://github.com/rk700/PyMuPDF/wiki>`_ and much more.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        For all `Windows <https://github.com/JorjMcKie/PyMuPDF-wheels/tree/windows>`_ versions XP/SP2 and up, and popular `Max OS <https://github.com/JorjMcKie/PyMuPDF-wheels/tree/osx>`_ and `Linux <https://github.com/JorjMcKie/PyMuPDF-wheels/tree/linux>`_ versions, we are providing wheels - see the download section of this site. For Windows users, `zip-based installation <https://github.com/JorjMcKie/PyMuPDF-Optional-Material>`_ options are also available. Other platforms need to download and generate the MuPDF library first and then set up PyMuPDF. Do visit our GitHub home, which has more details on this, including latest bugfixes, pre-releases, etc.
        
        Usage and Documentation
        ========================
        
        For all document types you can render pages in raster (PNG) or vector (SVG) formats, extract text and access meta information, links, annotations and bookmarks, as well as decrypt the document. For PDF files, most of this information can also be modified. Plus you can rotate, re-arrange, duplicate, create, or delete pages and join or split documents.
        
        Specifically for PDF files, PyMuPDF provides update access to low-level structure information, supports handling of embedded files and modification of page contents (like inserting images, fonts, text and drawings). Latest features include embedding vectorized images (SVG, PDF) such as logos or watermarks, "posterizing" a PDF or creating "booklet" and "4-up" versions.
        
        Our home page provides many examples and How-Tos for all of this. At a minimum, read the tutorial section of our documentation.
