Description: # toothpick
        
        Toothpick is a mini "library" which contains some implementation of machine learning algorithms in Python3.6. These algorithm 
        are built on NumPy. **This "library" is just a toy**, the reason why I create it is to share my ideas and codes. 
        All algorithms have `fit` and `predict` interface like `scikit-learn`. When I implemented these algorithms, I referenced
        some books as follows: _Machine Learning_ writen by ZhiHua Zhou, _Statistical Learning Method_ writen by Hang Li and 
        _Machine Learning in Action_ writen by Peter Harrington.
        
        By the way, I am a novice in python and machine learning field, so you can put forward issues if you find some bugs or questions.
        
        ## Why named toothpick?
        
        A toothpick is a small stick of wood, plastic, bamboo, or other substance used to remove detritus from the teeth, usually
        after a meal(from wikipedia). This library is similarly small and you can "take" it after meal :P.
        
        ## How to guarantee the correctness?
        
        I compared my implementation with scikit-learn's when I was implementing these algorithms, which you can find in every single python file
        and these performance were approximate on some very simple data set.
