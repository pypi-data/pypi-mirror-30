        ==========
        
        |Build Status| |GitHub release| |PyPI|
        
        This is a Python package to interface with an Insteon Powerline Modem
        (formerly called "PowerLinc"). It should work with either the USB or
        RS-232 serial based devices such as the
        `2413U <https://www.insteon.com/powerlinc-modem-usb>`__,
        `2412S <https://www.insteon.com/powerlinc-modem-serial>`__, and
        `2448A7 <http://www.insteon.com/usb-wireless-adapter>`__. Other models
        have not been tested but the underlying protocol is dusty and ancient
        and I wouldn't be surprised to learned that this package works fine on
        some Bakelite X10 oddity from the 1980s. If you find success with
        something, please let me know.
        
        PowerLinc Modems are not telephony devices, they provide a Serial or USB
        interface to an on-premisis Insteon IoT device network. This is either a
        powerline signalling protocol, an RF wireless protocol, ar a dual-band
        hybrid network.
        
        If you're looking for a library to work wtih the emulated PLM offered by
        an INSTEON `Hub <https://www.insteon.com/which-hub-are-you>`__ like the
        2245 you might be able to use the
        `insteonlocal <https://github.com/phareous/insteonlocal>`__ package.
        
        This package was created primarily to support an insteonplm platform for
        the `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`__ automation platform
        but it is structured to be general-purpose and should be usable for
        other applications as well.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  Python 3.4 or 3.5 with asyncio
        -  Some form of Insteon PLM or INSTEON USB Stick
        -  At least one Insteon device
        
        Known Issues
        ------------
        
        -  There's basically no documentation.
        -  2412S support is untested and strictly theoretical.
        -  X10 protocol support is not implented yet.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can, of course, just install the most recent release of this package
        using ``pip``. This will download the more rececnt version from
        `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/insteonplm>`__ and install it to
        your host.
        
        ::
        
            pip install insteonplm
        
        If you want to grab the the development code, you can also clone this
        git repository and install from local sources:
        
        ::
        
            cd python-insteonplm
            pip install .
        
        And, as you probably expect, you can live the developer's life by
        working with the live repo and edit to your heart's content:
        
        ::
        
            cd python-insteonplm
            pip install -e .
        
        Device Permissions
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Any user account that you want to be able to access the PLM will need
        permissions to access the USB or Serial device in ``/dev``. In Linux,
        you'll probably want to do something like this:
        
        ::
        
            sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>
        
        In FreeBSD, it'll be something like:
        
        ::
        
            sudo pw usermod <username> -G dialer
        
        You may find that you have to log out and log back in as that user for
        the change to take effect on existing sessions.
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        The package installs a command-line tool which will connect to your
        receiver, power it up, and then monitor all activity and changes that
        take place. The code for this console monitor is in
        ``insteonplm/tools.py`` and you can invoke it by simply running this at
        the command line with the appropriate IP and port number that matches
        your receiver and its configured port:
        
        ::
        
            insteonplm_monitor --device /dev/ttyUSB0

        How can you help?
        -----------------
        
        -  First and foremost, you can help by forking this project and coding.
           Features, bug fixes, documentation, and sample code will all add
           tremendously to the quality of this project.
        
        -  If you have a feature you'd love to see added to the project but you
           don't think that you're able to do the work, I'm someone is probably
           happy to perform the directed development in the form of a bug or
           feature bounty.
        
        -  If you're anxious for a feature but it's not actually worth money to
           you, please open an issue here on Github describing the problem or
           limitation. If you never ask, it'll never happen
        
        -  If you just want to thank me for the work I've already done, I'm
           happy to accept your thanks, gratitude, pizza, or bitcoin. My bitcoin
           wallet address can be on `Keybase <https://keybase.io/nugget>`__ or
           you can send me a donation via
           `PayPal <https://www.paypal.me/macnugget>`__.
        
        -  Or, if you're not comfortable sending me money directly, I'll be
           nearly as thrilled (really) if you donate to `the
           ACLU <https://action.aclu.org/donate-aclu>`__,
           `EFF <https://supporters.eff.org/donate/>`__, or
