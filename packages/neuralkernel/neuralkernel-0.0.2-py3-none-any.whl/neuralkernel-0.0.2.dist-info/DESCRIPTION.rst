This project uses modeling of neural networks as a general-purpose computational framework. Specifically, this project is interested in replicating operations on continuous-time signals. It builds off of the ideas and networks outlined by Xavier Lagorce and Ryad Benosman.

### Usage

To test various networks, you just need to run `app.py`.

```bash
python app.py
```

The networks currently implemented are:

* Inverting Memory
* Logarithm
* Maximum
* Non-Inverting Memory
* Synchronizer

For more information on each of these networks, please check out the `docs` folder.
