Description: rpmbuild-chain
        ==============
        
        This program builds a series of SRPMs with rpmbuild.
        
        Each resulting RPM is added to a local YUM repository, making them
        available as build dependencies for subsequent SRPMs. This is similar
        in operation to mockchain, except the RPMs are built in the local system
        instead of a dedicated build chroot. This is useful for building a small
        series of RPMs that will be installed onto the same system, e.g. during
        container builds.
        
        Optionally, any RPMs installed or removed to satisify build dependencies
        can be rolled back after the build has finished, provided they are still
        available in the configured YUM repositories.
        
        Warning: Installed packages and changes to the system may unknowingly
        affect the produced RPMs between builds. In almost every case,
        mock/mockchain is the recommended way to build RPMs using consistent
        reproducible clean buildroots, especially if they are to be redistributed
        to other systems. When satisifying build-dependencies, some packages
        may be temporarily uninstalled, so its not recommended to run this on
        live production hosts.
        
        This program must be run as "root" in order to install any missing build
        dependencies. All other commands (e.g. rpmbuild) are executed under the
        specified non-root user to improve security.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        **BETA**. All necessary functionality should be there. After test running
        for a while I'll bump it to version 1.0.

            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              --srpms SRPMS [SRPMS ...]
                                    Input SRPM files to build. If directory, recursively
                                    scan for RPMs. Use "-" to read list from STDIN
                                    (default: [])
              --user USER           Non-privileged user to run rpmbuild (default: None)
              --repo-path REPO_PATH
                                    Destination directory to store the built RPMs
                                    (default: rpmbuild-chain)
              --repo-name REPO_NAME
                                    Name for the YUM repository configuration (default:
                                    rpmbuild-chain)
              --build-path BUILD_PATH
                                    Directory to build the RPMs in. Use tmpfs for faster
                                    builds. Default: tmpdir (default: None)
              --order ORDER [ORDER ...]
                                    Package build order, given by list of package names
                                    (default: [])
              --order-files ORDER_FILES [ORDER_FILES ...]

              --no-rollback-builddep
                                    Do not automatically rollback installed RPM

              --keep-repo-config    Keep YUM repository configured after exiting (default:
                                    False)
              --allow-scriptlets    Do not abort if RPM scriptlets are found. Warning:
                                    scriptlets will be run as root when package is
                                    installed (default: False)
              --hookdir HOOKDIR [HOOKDIR ...]
                                    Hook script directory(s). Valid subdirectories:
