New Features
============

* Added support for Gerrit_ as a hosting service.

  Gerrit is a Git repository management and code review service used by
  many open source projects and teams at companies. We've had many requests
  from users who want to leverage Gerrit for repository management but to
  continue using Review Board for code review.

  Review Board now supports posting code for review against a Gerrit
  repository. All code review continues to happen through Review Board. This
  does require the use of our own gerrit-reviewboard-plugin_ for Gerrit, which
  provides additional API needed by Review Board.

* Added support for the modern GitLab_ API.

  Review Board now makes use of the modern GitLab API version 4. This is a
  more stable API, offering additional benefits like nested groups and better
  pagination for those hosting hundreds of repositories.

  Older GitLab installs using the older version 3 API will continue to work.
  Review Board will fall back on that if version 4 is not available.

* Added support for repositories with self-signed SSL certificates.

  Repositories served over HTTPS and using self-signed SSL certificates will
  now prompt you to accept the certificate when adding or updating the
  repository. This works with self-hosted Bitbucket Server, Gerrit, GitHub
  Enterprise, GitLab, and RB-Gateway services.

  Python 2.7.9 or higher is required for working with self-signed SSL
  certificates.

* :rbintegration:`AWS CodeCommit <aws-codecommit>`,
  :rbintegration:`Bitbucket Server <bitbucket-server>`, and
  :rbintegration:`Visual Studio Team Services <visual-studio-team-services>`
  now appear with instructions when configuring repositories.

  Support for these services are provided by `Power Pack`_. If Power Pack is
  not installed, we now list these services in order to help provide guidance
  on how to download and enable support.

* Added optional URL arguments for filtering the diff viewer.

  The diff viewer now accepts an optional ``?filenames=`` argument in the URL
  for specifying a comma-separated list of filenames or Unix-style filename
  patterns to show. This allows URLs to be crafted, either by hand or from
  an extension, that shows only a subset of the files in a diff. These filters
  are retained when switching diff revisions or moving to other pages in a
  multi-page diff.

  There's no UI for this today, but we may add this in a future release. See
  the :ref:`documentation <diffviewer-filter-files>` for more information
  on using this feature.

Extensions
==========

* Added a new :command:`rbext create` command for creating extension source
  trees.

  :command:`rbext create` will generate a complete source tree for a brand new
  extension and its packaging, optionally enabling support for static media
  files and configuration. This lets extension authors begin iterating on an
  extension quickly. The generated extension can immediately be installed and
  enabled by Review Board.

  See the :ref:`documentation <rbext-create>` for usage instructions.

* Added new :ref:`template hooks <extensions-template-hook>` for the review
  request box.

  These allow for more fine-grained placement of information without having
  to manipulate the DOM. The new ones added are:

  * ``before-review-request-summary``
  * ``after-review-request-summary``
  * ``review-request-summary-pre``
  * ``review-request-summary-post``
  * ``before-review-request-fields``
  * ``after-review-request-fields``
  * ``before-review-request-extra-panes``
  * ``after-review-request-extra-panes``
  * ``review-request-extra-panes-pre``
  * ``review-request-extra-panes-post``

  See the :ref:`documentation <extensions-template-hook>` for details on
  these new hook points.


Web API
=======

* :ref:`webapi2.0-review-request-resource` no longer allows publishing
  when reviewers aren't specified. (:bug:`4057`)

  Patch by Maram El-Salamouny.


Bug Fixes
=========

General
-------

* Fixed a deadlock that could sometimes occur during thread shutdown.

  We tracked down an issue that could sometimes occur with threads that have
  handled file attachment uploads, where they'd operate on garbage state and
  deadlock when mod_wsgi began shutting down or replacing threads.

  If you encounter issues where Apache is occassionally not responding to
  requests after upgrading to this release, please let us know.


Diff Viewer
-----------

* Fixed several problems with move detection not catching certain lines or
  representing move ranges incorrectly in complex situations.


Review Requests
---------------

* The change description field for a draft no longer appears empty when
  first loading the page.

* Extra unwanted padding no longer appears at the top of some reviews.


Account Settings
----------------

* Improved the way we handle avatar settings and prevented additional
  problems with custom backends.

* Fixed a crash when viewing the :ref:`My Account <account-settings>` page
  when syntax highlighting was turned off for the server.


Integrations
------------

* Fixed a problem where integrations with custom configuration forms could
  end up not showing the Local Site field.


Mercurial
---------

* Fixed a crash when attempting to fetch the very first commit in a
  repository.

  Patch by André Klitzing.

* Removed the need for the mercurial_ package to be installed on the server
  when using hgweb_ for repository communication.

  Patch by André Klitzing.

Active Directory
----------------

  (:bug:`4658`)


Administration
--------------

* The user selector for groups and default reviewers no longer breaks if
  a user doesn't have any avatars configured. (:bug:`4655`)

* Fixed a bug in the ``loaddb`` management command where errors importing a
  database dump weren't properly rolling back the transaction. (:bug:`4629`)

  Patch by Jeremie Corriveau.

* Fixed the help text for the :guilabel:`Media URL` and :guilabel:`Static URL`
  fields in General Settings.
