## About the BaseCon Library ##

BaseCon is a single class library for converting integers into base 2 - 65 encoded, url-safe, strings. It is simple to use and sometimes very fast for it utilizes built-in functions like `bin`, `oct`, `str` and `hex` when converting integers to base 2, 8, 10, 16 encoded strings; and it uses `int` when converting base 2 - 36 encoded strings into integers.

This library, however, is not compatible with the builtin base64 converter as one of the main purpose of this library is to keep the converted string url-safe. And the library currently does not support converting binary data.

One can use this library, for example, to create short link handles when using with auto increment database insertions, which can keep the generated handles short. 

## How to Use BaseCon Library ##

After installation with `pip install BaseCon`, simply import BaseCon, instantiate and use with `encode` (`convert`) and `decode` (`revert`) methods. The default base is 62 for it only uses 0-9, A-Z and a-z when encoding. One can simply change the base when instantiating.

```python
from basecon import BaseCon

basecon = BaseCon() # default base is 62
# encode integer
basecon(100) # '1c', __call__ method
basecon.encode(100) # '1c'
basecon.convert(100) # '1c
# decode string
basecon('1c', False) # 100
basecon.decode('1c') # 100
basecon.revert('1c') # 100

# change the base
basecon = BaseCon(16) # change the base to 16
basecon(128) # '80'
basecon.encode(128) # '80'
basecon.convert(128) # '80'
basecon('80', False)
basecon.decode('80')
basecon.revert('80')
```

## BaseCon Class API References ##

`BaseCon` class is the only class exported for this library.

Signature: `BaseCon(base = 62)`

### BaseCon Class ###

`encode(data)` or `convert(data)`: encode an integer to string
`decode(data)` or `revert(data)`: decode a string to integer
`__call__(data, switch = True)`: encode/decode a payload, if switch is set to True, then it encodes; if it is set to False then it decodes.
