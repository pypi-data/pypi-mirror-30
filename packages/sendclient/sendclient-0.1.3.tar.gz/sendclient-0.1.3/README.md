Warning, Sharp Edges!
- will overwrite the output file without warning, but does prompt for the output filename
- Uses temp files to avoid using large amount of memory, you will need at least 2GB of free disk space to upload a 2GB file
- Very limited error checking
- expect serious issues such as data loss if precautions are not taken (you are using a service where destroying your data is a feature, use common sense)

Issues for bugs/features/mistakes/comments on coding style are all very welcome, please also feel free to open pull requests for nits/petty changes.
