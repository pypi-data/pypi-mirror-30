        Type Routes:
        To satisfy an expansion, the expansion processing code needs to know
        which service action to call and how to call it. Type routes solve this
        problem by by giving the expansion processing code all the information
        it needs to properly call a service action to satisfy an expansion.

        <type> is the type of the expansion.
        <service name> is the name of the service to call.
        <action name> is the name of the action to call.
        <request field> is the name of the field to use in the ActionRequest
            body. The value of the field will be the expansion identifier
            extracted from the object being expanded.
        <response field> is the name of the field returned in the
            ActionResponse body that contains the expansion object.

        Type Expansions:
        Type expansions detail the expansions that are supported for each type.
        If a type wishes to support expansions, it must have a corresponding
        entry in the Type Expansions Configuration dictionary.

        <type> is a type for which you are defining expansions.
        <expansion name> is the name of an expansion.
        <expansion type> is the type of the expansion. This is used to look up
            the appropriate expansion route in the Type Route Configuration.
        <source field name> is the name of the field on an object of type
            <type> that contains the value of the expansion identifier.
        <destination field name> is the name of the field on an object of type
            <type> that will be filled with the expanded value.
