Description: Asynchronous library for accessing Swagger-1.1-enabled APIs
 About
 -----
 .
 aioswagger11 is an asyncio-compatible clone of swagger.py, capable of
 understanding Swagger 1.1 definitions (only).
 .
 As swagger has been renamed to OpenAPI which by now has version 3.0
 (and has an actual specification â€“ unlike Swagger 1.1) this library is
 (mostly) only usable with Asterisk, which still uses Swagger 1.1
 declarations.
 .
 Aioswagger11 supports a WebSocket extension, allowing a WebSocket to
 be documented, and auto-generated WebSocket client code.
 .
 from swagger.py:
 ================
 .
 Swagger.py is a Python library for using
 `Swagger <https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/>`__ defined APIs.
