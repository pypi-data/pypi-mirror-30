CPLOY
=====

|License: GPL v3|

*The ad hoc continuous deployment solution for developers*

I sometimes have to code stuff that needs to be run on remote hosts.
Since I don’t have all my prefs/settings/dotfiles/etc on the remote, I
usually code on local and have a small one-liner lying around that
allows me to quickly deploy the code (with ``scp`` or similar) and run
some command on the other side (with ``ssh`` for example). This is not
optimal and that’s the reason I created *cploy*.

*Cploy* allows to mirror changes performed on a local directory to a
remote host through SSH. A specific command (bash oneliner for example)
can be run after any change for example to trigger a build.

Features:

-  handle multiple syncs in parallel
-  sync is done through SSH
-  can be daemonized
-  allows to provide a specific command to run on each local change
-  allows to exclude some files from sync

Quick start:

.. code:: bash

    # install cploy
    sudo pip3 install cploy
    # start the daemon
    cploy daemon start
    # add a directory to sync
    cploy sync /tmp/local someuser@somehost /tmp/remote

Installation
============

To install run:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo pip3 install cploy

Or from github directly

.. code:: bash

    $ cd /tmp; git clone https://github.com/deadc0de6/cploy && cd cploy
    $ sudo python3 setup.py install
    $ cploy --help

To work with *cploy* without installing it, you can do the following

.. code:: bash

    $ cd /tmp; git clone https://github.com/deadc0de6/cploy && cd cploy
    $ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    $ python3 -m cploy.cploy --help

or install it in a virtualenv

.. code:: bash

    $ cd /tmp; git clone https://github.com/deadc0de6/cploy && cd cploy
    $ virtualenv -p python3 env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ python setup.py install
    $ cploy --help

Usage
=====

The usual way of using *cploy* is by starting the daemon and adding
tasks to it (directories to sync between local and a remote host).

Start the daemon

.. code:: bash

    $ cploy daemon start --debug

and then add tasks to it:

.. code:: bash

    # sync dir /tmp/local on localhost to
    # /tmp/remote on host somehost
    $ cploy sync /tmp/local/ somehost /tmp/remote

Usage:

.. code:: bash

    cploy
    Usage:
        cploy sync [-dfF] [-p <port>] [-u <user>] [-P <pass>]
            [-k <key>] [-K <pass>] [-c <cmd>] [-e <pattern>...]
            <local_path> <hostname> <remote_path>
        cploy daemon [-d] (start | stop | restart)
        cploy daemon [-d] (info | ping | debug)
        cploy daemon unsync <id>
        cploy daemon resync <id>
        cploy --help
        cploy --version

    Options:
        -p --port=<port>          SSH port to use [default: 22].
        -u --user=<user>          username for SSH [default: drits].
        -k --key=<key>            Path of SSH private key to use.
        -P --pass=<pass>          SSH password to use.
        -K --keypass=<pass>       SSH private key passphrase.
        -e --exclude=<pattern>    Pattern to exclude using fnmatch.
        -c --command=<cmd>        Command to execute on changes.
        -F --front                Do not daemonize.
        -f --force                Force overwrite on remote [default: False].
        -d --debug                Enable debug [default: False].
        -v --version              Show version.
        -h --help                 Show this screen.

Remote host
-----------

Connections to a remote hosts is done using SFTP (SSH). Multiple options
can be changed: connection with password, with SSH keys, using the SSH
agent, different port, different username, etc.

Besides using the above options, The ** argument can also be provided
using a format similar to what the SSH client provides: *@:*.

Talking with the daemon
-----------------------

A few commands are available to talk to the daemon:

-  *start*: start the daemon
-  *stop*: stop the daemon
-  *restart*: stop and then start the daemon
-  *info*: get a list of current tasks
-  *ping*: ping the daemon
-  *debug*: toggle debug flag
-  *unsync*: stop syncing a specific task
-  *resync*: do a full sync starting from local of the sync’ed directory

If you prefer not to use the daemon, it can also be run in the
foreground by using the ``--front`` switch.

Excluding
---------

Files can be excluded within the monitored directory by using
``--exclude``. Matching is done using
`fnmatch <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/fnmatch.html>`__.

Exclude any hidden files:

::

    --exclude '*/.*'

Exclude any files containing *test*

::

    --exclude '*/test*'

Issues and bugs
===============

This hasn’t been extensively tested so please do report any bug you
find. Starting the daemon with ``--debug`` is always helpful to get more
info (or toggle it with the daemon command *debug*).

Contribution
============

If you are having trouble installing or using *cploy*, open an issue.

If you want to contribute, feel free to do a PR (please follow PEP8).
