*The ad hoc continuous deployment solution for developers*

I sometimes have to code stuff that needs to be deployed and run on
remote hosts. Since I don’t have all my prefs/settings/dotfiles/etc on
the remote, I usually code on local and have a small one-liner lying
around that allows me to quickly deploy the code (with ``scp`` or
similar) and run some command on the other side (with ``ssh`` for
example). This is not optimal and that’s the reason I created *cploy*.

*Cploy* allows to mirror changes performed on a local directory to a
remote host through SSH. A specific command (bash one-liner for example)
can be run after any change, for example to trigger a build or execute a
script.

Features:

-  handle multiple syncs in parallel
-  secure sync through SSH
-  can be daemonized
-  allows to provide a specific command to run on each local change
-  allows to exclude some files from sync

Quick start:

.. code:: bash

    # install cploy
    sudo pip3 install cploy
    # start the daemon
    cploy daemon start
    # add a directory to sync
    cploy sync /tmp/local someuser@somehost /tmp/remote

Installation
============

To install run:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo pip3 install cploy

Or from github directly

.. code:: bash

    $ cd /tmp; git clone https://github.com/deadc0de6/cploy && cd cploy
    $ sudo python3 setup.py install
    $ cploy --help

To work with *cploy* without installing it, you can do the following

.. code:: bash

    $ cd /tmp; git clone https://github.com/deadc0de6/cploy && cd cploy
    $ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    $ python3 -m cploy.cploy --help

or install it in a virtualenv

.. code:: bash

    $ cd /tmp; git clone https://github.com/deadc0de6/cploy && cd cploy
    $ virtualenv -p python3 env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ python setup.py install
    $ cploy --help

Usage
=====

The usual way of using *cploy* is by starting the daemon and adding
tasks to it (directory to mirror on a remote host).

Once a new task is added, every changes in the monitored directory is
mirrored on the remote host through SSH.

Start the daemon

.. code:: bash

    $ cploy daemon start --debug

and then add a task to it:

.. code:: bash

    # sync dir /tmp/local on localhost to
    # /tmp/remote on host "somehost"
    $ cploy sync /tmp/local/ somehost /tmp/remote

Check the logs for any issue under ``/tmp/cploy/cploy.log``.

Usage:

::

    cploy

    Usage:
        cploy sync [-dfF] [-p <port>] [-u <user>] [-P <pass>]
            [-k <key>] [-K <pass>] [-c <cmd>] [-e <pattern>...]
            <local_path> <hostname> <remote_path>
        cploy daemon [-d] (start | stop | restart)
        cploy daemon [-d] (info | ping | debug)
        cploy daemon unsync <id>
        cploy daemon resync <id>
        cploy --help
        cploy --version

    Options:
        -p --port=<port>          SSH port to use [default: 22].
        -u --user=<user>          username for SSH [default: $USER].
        -k --key=<key>            Path of SSH private key to use.
        -P --pass=<pass>          SSH password to use.
        -K --keypass=<pass>       SSH private key passphrase.
        -e --exclude=<pattern>    Pattern to exclude using fnmatch.
        -c --command=<cmd>        Command to execute on changes.
        -F --front                Do not daemonize.
        -f --force                Force overwrite on remote [default: False].
        -d --debug                Enable debug [default: False].
        -v --version              Show version.
        -h --help                 Show this screen.

Connection
----------

Connections to a remote hosts is done using SFTP (SSH). Multiple options
can be changed: connection with password, with SSH keys, using the SSH
agent, different port, different username, etc.

Besides using the above switches, The ** argument can also be provided
using a compact format similar to what the SSH client provides:

::

    <username>@<hostname>:<port>

Remote path
-----------

The ``<remote_path>`` is normalized based on the default user’s
directory on the remote (usually ``$HOME``). For example
``../../tmp/test`` would result in ``/tmp/test`` if the remote user’s
home is ``/home/user``.

Note that shell expansions are not performed on remote paths (like ``~``
for example) neither are environment variables (like ``$HOME``).

Adding a task
-------------

Tasks can be added by using the ``sync`` command.

After adding a task, make sure to check the daemon to see if the task
has been added successfully with ``cploy daemon info``. In case it
wasn’t, checking the logs in ``/tmp/cploy/cploy.log`` usually allows to
identify the issue.

Once a new task is added, *cploy* will start by copying any local
existing files to the remote directory to initiate the mirror. Then, any
change to the local directory is applied on the remote.

Requirements:

-  SSH access is working (obviously)
-  remote host key is trusted
-  local directory exists (``<local_path>``)
-  remote directory does not exist (``<remote_path>``) unless
   ``--force`` is used

Talking with the daemon
-----------------------

A few commands are available to talk to the daemon with the ``daemon``
command:

-  **start**: start the daemon
-  **stop**: stop the daemon
-  **restart**: stop and then start the daemon
-  **info**: get a list of current tasks
-  **ping**: ping the daemon
-  **debug**: toggle debug flag
-  **unsync**: stop syncing a specific task
-  **resync**: do a full sync starting from local of the sync’ed
   directory

If you prefer not to use the daemon, *cploy*\ ’s daemon can also be run
in the foreground by using the ``--front`` switch. However only a single
task can be added to it then.

Getting information from the daemon allows to see the different task
running and their id:

.. code:: bash

    $ cploy daemon info

Exclusion
---------

Files can be excluded from the sync in the monitored directory by using
the ``--exclude`` switch. Matching is done using
`fnmatch <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/fnmatch.html>`__.

Example: exclude any hidden files

::

    --exclude '*/.*'

Example: exclude any files containing *test*

::

    --exclude '*/test*'

Sync events
-----------

Here is a list of changes that are mirrored on the remote:

-  File creation
-  File deletion
-  File attribute change
-  File content modification
-  File move

Run a command on change
-----------------------

A command can be added to a task using the ``--command`` switch. The
provided command will be run on the remote anytime a change is applied
on the local monitored directory.

*Cploy* uses paramiko channel’s
`exec_command <http://docs.paramiko.org/en/2.4/api/channel.html#paramiko.channel.Channel>`__
to execute the command which will be run from the default directory of
the user (usually ``$HOME``).

Therefore if the remote directory is ``/tmp/remote`` and the script to
run remotely is located in ``/tmp/remote/test.sh``, the command argument
will be ``--command="/tmp/remote/test.sh"``.

Currently the specified command is run on any change with no control
over the granularity.

Issues and bugs
===============

This hasn’t been extensively tested so please do report any bug you
find. Starting the daemon with ``--debug`` is always helpful to get more
info (or toggle it with the daemon command ``debug``).

Contribution
============

If you are having trouble installing or using *cploy*, open an issue.

If you want to contribute, feel free to do a PR (please follow PEP8).
