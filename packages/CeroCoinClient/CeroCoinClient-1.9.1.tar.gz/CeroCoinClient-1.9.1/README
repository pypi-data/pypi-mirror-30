The CeroCoinClient module is meant to be used in a classroom
setting for explaining the following three fundamental
concepts in crypto currencies: (1) What it means to mine a
coin; (2) How the ownership of a coin is transferred from
one CeroCoin client to another; and (3) How the notion of
blockchain is used to prevent "double-spending".  By
definition, a crypto currency can only exist in a network of
nodes.  For the CeroCoin network, each node must execute
this module.
