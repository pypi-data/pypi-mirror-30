        for all information related to this module, including
        information regarding the latest changes to the code. The
        page at the URL shown above lists all of the module
        functionality you can invoke in your own code.  That page
        also explains how the module can be used in a classroom
        setting to explain the following three fundamental concepts
        in crypto currencies: (1) What it means to mine a coin; (2)
        How the ownership of a coin is transferred from one CeroCoin
        client to another; and (3) How the notion of blockchain is
        used to prevent "double-spending".
        
        Typical usage syntax for creating a CeroCoin client after you have installed the module:
        
        ::
        
                ceronode = CeroCoinClient.CeroCoinClient(
                                                  cerocoin_network           =  network,
                                                  modulus_size               =  M,
                                                  starting_pow_difficulty    =  N,
                                                  num_transactions_in_block  =  K,
                                                  max_iterations_debug_mode  =  200,
                           )
                ceronode.initialize_node_and_run()
