    Gustav tries to handle all of the aspects of experimentation that are 
    common across experiments (organizing and enumerating experimental 
    variables, the psychophysical procedure, interacting with subjects, 
    logging, saving data, etc.), and leaves to the experimenter the aspects 
    that are unique to each experiment (stimulus generation and delivery, etc). 
    
    An experiment is represented by a Gustav experiment file, which is simply 
    a python script that has various functions and properties specified. For 
    example, the setup function is where many aspects of the experiment are 
    set, such as the name of the experiment, where and how to save data, what 
    the experimental variables and their levels are, and so on. The best way 
    to understand how one works is to have a look at one. See the test_gustav 
    python scripts in the user_scripts directory for more information.
