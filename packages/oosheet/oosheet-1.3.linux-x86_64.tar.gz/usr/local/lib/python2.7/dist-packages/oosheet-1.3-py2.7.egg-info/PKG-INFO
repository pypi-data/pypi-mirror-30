Description: 
        oosheet is a module developing OpenOffice.org Spreadsheet automated routines using Python.
        
        Documentation is available at http://oosheet.readthedocs.io/ or else, you can build it from source like this::
            
            $ easy_install Sphinx
            $ cd docs
            $ make html
        
        then open _build/html/index.html in your web browser.
        
        To run tests, make sure you don't have an instance of OO.org running, and then::
        
            $ python oosheet/tests/run_tests.py
        
        You're supposed to be using a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution, other environments were not tested, but should work in any GNU/Linux environment.
        
        Tests assume you have your OpenOffice.org in English - USA default language.
