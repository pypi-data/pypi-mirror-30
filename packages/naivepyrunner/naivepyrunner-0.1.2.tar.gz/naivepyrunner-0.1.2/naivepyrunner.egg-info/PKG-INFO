Description: # Naive Python Runner
        ## What does it do?
        naivepyrunner is library to schedule a small amount of timed tasks that may need to perform repeatedly. It does not claim to always choose the right execution order of those tasks to minimize the overall delay if it is running under limited ressources, but it does try to do so.
        
        ## How does it work?
        ## Why is it naive?
        The runner assumes that the list with yet to execute tasks does not change while calculating the optimal position for the task. This may lead to not optimal positioning
