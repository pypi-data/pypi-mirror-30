Description: ``wilson`` is a Python library for matching and running Wilson coefficients of
        higher-dimensional operators beyond the Standard Model. Provided with the numer-
        ical values of the Wilson coefficients at a high new physics scale, it automatically per-
        forms the renormalization group evolution within the Standard Model effective field
        theory (SMEFT), matching onto the weak effective theory (WET) at the electroweak
        scale, and QCD/QED renormalization group evolution below the electroweak scale
        down to hadronic scales relevant for low-energy precision tests. The matching and
        running encompasses the complete set of dimension-six operators in both SMEFT
        and WET. The program builds on the Wilson coefficient exchange format (WCxf)
        and can thus be easily combined with a number of existing public codes.
