Version 1.0 To Dos
------------------

+ Make project a pure, Python-only package.
  * Remove Debian support (debian/, man/)
  * Remove Windows support

+ Proper .gitignore

+ Remove ezs code. It is deprecated.

+ Remove xmlrev support. It does not really work, since some of the most
  important functions are not implemented.

+ Remove xupdate support. It has never become a proper standard
  * We might be able to easily add XML PATCH support instead.

+ Rename mydifflib.py into something more suitable.

- Code cleanup:
  * Remove trailing whitespace.
  * PEP8, especially docstrings

- Modernize package:
  + Proper src/ directory
  * Python 2.7 and 3.7 support.
  * lxml-based SAX parser.
  + Proper setup.py file in modern format.
  + Setup py.test and tox to run tests.
  * Allow code to be run without C extensions
    (See Zope packages with PyPy support for help.)
  + Create proper console script
  * Make releasable with zest.releaser
  * Remove old optimizations due to slow attribute lookup
    e.g. mapping = self._mapping
  * Proper LGPL file headers with copyright notice.

- Systematic test setup.
  * Use Shoobx approach for XML-processing-based testing.
  + Start measuring test coverage.

- Bonus: Make some of the variables more readable and rem
