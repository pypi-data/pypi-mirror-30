In the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification,
a confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, is a specific table layout that allows visualization of
the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one (in unsupervised learning it is usually
called a matching matrix). Each row of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each column
represents the instances in an actual class (or vice versa) pycm(python confusion matrix) is a multi-class
confusion matrix library in python.
