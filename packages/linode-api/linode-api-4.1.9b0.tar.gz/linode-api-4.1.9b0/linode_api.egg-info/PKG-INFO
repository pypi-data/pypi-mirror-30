        Installation
        ------------
        ::
        
            pip install linode-api
        
        Building from Source
        --------------------
        
        To build and install this package:
        
        - Clone this repository
        - ``./setup.py install``
        
        This package uses the ``linode`` namespace.  This could conflict with libraries
        intended for previous versions of the Linode API.  Please be cautious when
        installing packages for both version of the API on the same machine.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Check out the `Getting Started guide`_ to start using this library, or read
        `the docs`_ for extensive documentation.
        
        .. _Getting Started guide: http://python-linode-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/getting_started.html
        .. _the docs: http://python-linode-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        See the `Install on a Linode`_ example project for a simple use case demonstrating
        many of the features of this library.

        Tests
        -----
        
        Tests live in the ``tests`` directory.  To run tests, use setup.py:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
           python setup.py test
        
        The test suite uses fixtures stored as JSON in ``test/fixtures``.  These files
        contain sanitized JSON responses from the API - the file name is the URL called
        to produce the response, replacing any slashes with underscores.
        
        Test classes should extend ``test.base.ClientBaseCase``.  This provides them
        with ``self.client``, a ``LinodeClient`` object that is set up to work with
        tests.  Importantly, any GET request made by this object will be mocked to
        retrieve data from the test fixtures.  This includes lazy-loaded objects using
        this client (and by extension related models).
        
        When testing against requests other than GET requests, ``self.mock_post`` (and
        equivalent methods for other HTTP verbs) can be used in a ``with`` block to
        mock out the intended request type - include the URL whose response should be
        used returned from the fixtures.  For example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           with self.mock_post('/linode/instances/123'):
             linode = self.client.linode.create_instance('g5-standard-1', 'us-east')
             self.assertEqual(linode.id, 123) # passes
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        This library is documented with Sphinx_.  Docs live in the ``docs`` directory.
        The easiest way to build the docs is to run ``sphinx-autobuild`` in that
        folder.
        
        Classes and functions inside the library should be annotated with sphinx-compliant
        docstrings which will be used to automatically generate documentation for the
        library.  When contributing, be sure to update documentation or include new
        docstrings where applicable to keep the library's documentation up to date
        and useful.
        
        **Missing or inaccurate documentation is a bug**.  If you notice that the
        documentation for this library is out of date or unclear, please
        `open an issue`_ to make us aware of the problem.
