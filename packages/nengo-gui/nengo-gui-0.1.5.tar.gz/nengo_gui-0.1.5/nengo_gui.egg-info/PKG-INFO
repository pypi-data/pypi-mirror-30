        HTML5 interactive visualizer for `Nengo <https://github.com/nengo/nengo>`_.
        This lets you see the structure of a Nengo model, plot spiking activity and
        decoded representations, and adjust the inputs while the model is running.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
         - Python (tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4)
         - Nengo (which also requires NumPy)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The simplest way to install is with the standard Python installation system:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           pip install nengo_gui
        
        If you would like access the the development version of nengo_gui, you can
        download it from guthub:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           git clone https://github.com/nengo/nengo_gui
           cd nengo_gui
           python setup.py develop --user
        
        
        Running nengo_gui
        =================
        
        There are two ways to run nengo_gui.  First, you can use it from the command
        line by running the installed script:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           nengo_gui
        
        If you specify a file to load, nengo_gui will do so:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           nengo_gui myfile.py
        
        Alternatively, you can start nengo_gui manually from within your code.  To
        do so, add this to the bottom of your file that defines your Nengo model.
        
        .. code:: python
        
           import nengo_gui
           nengo_gui.GUI(__file__).start()
        
        
        Basic usage
        ===========
        
        The graph of the Nengo network should appear.  Rectangles are nengo.Nodes,
        ellipses are nengo.Ensembles, and rounded rectangles are nengo.Networks.
        
        Items can be dragged to move them and resized by dragging their edge or via
        the scroll wheel.
        
        To start (or continue) the simulation, click the play button in the lower
        right.  A spinning gear icon indicates the model is in the process of being
        built (or re-built after new graphs are added).
        
        Clicking on an item will show a menu of options, depending on what you
        have clicked on.  Here are some of the standard options for network items:
        
         - value:  show a graph of the decoded output value over time
         - xy-value: show a state-space plot of two decoded values against each other
         - spikes: show the spiking activity of the nengo.Ensemble
         - slider: show sliders that let you adjust the value in a nengo.Node
         - expand/collapse: reveal or hide the insides of a nengo.Network
        
        Once you have graphs, you can also click on them to adjust their options.  For
        example:
        
         - set range: adjust the limits of the graph
         - show label/hide label: whether to show the title at the top of the graph
         - remove: get rid of the graph
        
        The graphs record their data from previous time steps.  You can show this
        previous data by dragging the transparent area in the time axis at the
        bottom (beside the play button).

        - Added cross-hairs when hovering over plots.
        - Added several new types of plots, including a firing pattern plot,
          a similarity plot for SPA networks, and a plot for ``Compare`` networks.
        - Added the ability to implement custom HTML plots.
