        Temporalis
        **********
        
        This package provides a dynamic (i.e. varying in time) LCA calculations package for the `Brightway2 life cycle assessment framework <https://brightwaylca.org>`_. 
        
        Temporalis allows to perform dynamic LCA and take into account time in both inventory and impact assessment. It makes use of `graph traversal <https://docs.brightwaylca.org/lca.html#illustration-of-graph-traversal>`_ and `convolution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution>`_ to solve the inventory and makes it possible to use several types of impact assessment methods, both static and dynamic.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        The best way to install Temporalis is by using `conda <https://conda.io/docs/index.html>`_
        
        The safest is to first `install brightway2 <https://docs.brightwaylca.org/installation.html>`_ and within the same conda environment run
        
        .. ~.. code-block:: bash
        .. ~
        .. ~    conda install -y -c conda-forge -c cmutel -c haasad -c cardosan bw2temporalis
        .. ~
        .. ~You can also install directly Temporalis as above, also its dependencies are installed
        
        .. ~
        .. ~Temporalis can be installed also via pip from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bw2temporalis>`_ .
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install bw2temporalis
        
        
        which will also install all its dependencies
        
        Documentation and examples
        ==========================
        
        The `online documentation <http://temporalis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ explain the functioning of the software and how to use it.
        
        The article `Temporalis, a generic method for dynamic Life Cycle Assessment` (which is unfortunately still under review....) explains very nicely the methodology behind the software. `This repo <https://github.com/cardosan/dLCA>`_ contains the jupyter notebooks with the analysis performed with some nice real usage examples of the software.
        
        See also the `demonstration notebooks <https://bitbucket.org/cardosan/brightway2-temporalis/src/tip/docs/Temporalis%20demonstration%20Ecoinvent%20linking.ipynb?at=default&fileviewer=notebook-viewer%3Anbviewer>`_ and the `examples <https://bitbucket.org/cardosan/brightway2-temporalis/src/tip/bw2temporalis/examples/?at=default>`_.
