"""
Class that holds state of a game.

Takes two subclasses of Player as defined
in chess_py.players.player.Player, and calls 
``generate_move(position)``
from each of the players and updates the board using 
each corresponding result.

Start game using play(), which returns the result 
(1 - white wins, 0 - black wins, 0.5 - draw)
when the game is finished.
