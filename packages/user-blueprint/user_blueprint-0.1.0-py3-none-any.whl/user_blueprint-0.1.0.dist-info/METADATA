# Flask user handler blueprint

Flask blueprint that provides all the user handling features that are required by a web application in a database-independent way, including:

- User registration, login and session management.
- Password reset functionality with JWTs.
- Automatic, safe password handling using [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2).

The blueprint provides the following routes for a web application: `/login`, `/logout`, `/register`, `/request_password_reset` and `/reset/<token>`. All these routes interact with the user database through an instance of the `UserHandler` class that is a decorator-based database interface, similar to `Flask-Login`'s `LoginManager`. All the blueprint routes are backed by ready-to-use HTML templates that are formatted using [BlueprintJS](http://blueprintjs.com/docs/v2/).

## How to use

The blueprint requires the following components to be configured:

- `blueprint.user_handler`: See the documentation of the `UserHandler` class for the details.
- `LoginManager`: This `Flask-Login` component handles the session management of the Flask application. You need to create an instance of this class and configure it according to the documentation of `Flask-Login`.

A working demo Flask application showing all the described configuration is included in the library, see `demo.py`.

## Dependencies

The library requires the following dependencies to be installed.

- `Flask-Login`: User session management.
- `Passlib`: Password hashing and verification.
- `Argon2_cffi`: The preferred Argon2 backend for `Passlib`. See `Passlib`'s documentation for more options.

The library is open-sourced under the conditions of the MIT [license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
