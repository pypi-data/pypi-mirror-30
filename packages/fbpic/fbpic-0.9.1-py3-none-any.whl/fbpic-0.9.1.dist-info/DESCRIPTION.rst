Overview
--------

FBPIC is a `Particle-In-Cell (PIC)
code <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-in-cell>`__ for
relativistic plasma physics.

It is especially well-suited for physical simulations of
**laser-wakefield acceleration** and **plasma-wakefield acceleration**,
with close-to-cylindrical symmetry.

Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~

| The distinctive feature of FBPIC is to use a **spectral decomposition
  in cylindrical geometry** (Fourier-Bessel decomposition) for the
  fields. This combines the advantages of **spectral 3D** PIC codes
  (high accuracy and stability) and those of **finite-difference
  cylindrical** PIC codes (orders-of-magnitude speedup when compared to
  3D simulations).
| For more details on the algorithm, its advantages and limitations, see
  the `documentation <http://fbpic.github.io>`__.

Language and harware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FBPIC is written entirely in Python, but uses
`Numba <http://numba.pydata.org/>`__ Just-In-Time compiler for high
performance. In addition, the code can run on **CPU** (with
multi-threading) and on **GPU**. For large simulations, running the code
on GPU can be much faster than on CPU.

Advanced features of laser-plasma acceleration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FBPIC implements several useful features for laser-plasma acceleration,
including: - Moving window - Cylindrical geometry (with azimuthal mode
decomposition) - Calculation of space-charge fields at the beginning of
the simulation - Intrinsic mitigation of Numerical Cherenkov Radiation
(NCR) from relativistic bunches - Field ionization module (ADK model)

In addition, FBPIC supports the **boosted-frame** technique (which can
dramatically speed up simulations), and includes: - Utilities to convert
input parameters from the lab frame to the boosted frame - On-the-fly
conversion of simulation results from the boosted frame back to the lab
frame - Suppression of the Numerical Cherenkov Instability (NCI) using
the Galilean technique

Installation
------------

The installation instructions below are for a local computer. For more
details, or for instructions specific to a particular HPC cluster, see
the `documentation <http://fbpic.github.io>`__.

The recommended installation is through the
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda>`__ distribution. If
Anaconda is not your default Python installation, download and install
it from `here <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__.

**Installation steps**:

-  Install the dependencies of FBPIC. This can be done in two lines:

   ::

       conda install numba scipy h5py mkl
       conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py

-  Download and install FBPIC:

   ::

       pip install fbpic

-  **Optional:** in order to run on GPU, install the additional package
   ``pyculib``:

   ::

       conda install pyculib

-  **Optional:** in order to run on a CPU which is **not** an Intel
   model, you need to install ``pyfftw``, in order to replace the MKL
   FFT:

   ::

       conda install -c conda-forge pyfftw

Running simulations
-------------------

Once installed, FBPIC is available as a **Python module** on your
system.

Therefore, in order to run a physical simulation, you will need a
**Python script** that imports FBPIC's functionalities and use them to
setup the simulation. You can find examples of such scripts in the
`documentation <http://fbpic.github.io>`__ or in this repository, in
``docs/source/example_input/``.

Once your script is ready, the simulation is run simply by typing:

::

    python fbpic_script.py

The code outputs HDF5 files, that comply with the `OpenPMD
standard <http://www.openpmd.org/#/start>`__, and which can thus be read
as such (e.g. by using the
`openPMD-viewer <https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-viewer>`__).

Contributing
------------

We welcome contributions to the code! Please read `this
page <https://github.com/fbpic/fbpic/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__ for

FBPIC was originally developed by Remi Lehe at `Berkeley
Lab <http://www.lbl.gov/>`__, and Manuel Kirchen at `CFEL, Hamburg
University <http://lux.cfel.de/>`__. The code also benefitted from the
contributions of Soeren Jalas, Kevin Peters and Irene Dornmair (CFEL).

If you use FBPIC for your research project: that's great! We are very
pleased that the code is useful to you!
