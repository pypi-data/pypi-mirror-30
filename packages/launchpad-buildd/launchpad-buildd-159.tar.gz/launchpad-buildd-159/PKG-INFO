Description: The Launchpad buildd slave libraries.  The PyPI version of this
        package will not produce a complete installation on its own, and is
        mostly useful for testing other pieces of software against
        launchpad-buildd; for a real Launchpad buildd slave, install the
        launchpad-buildd package from ppa:launchpad/ubuntu/ppa.
