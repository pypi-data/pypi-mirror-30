geovoronoi is a small Python 3 package that uses SciPy to generate Voronoi regions for a given
set of points in a given geographic area. It then allows to intersect the geographic area with these Voronoi regions so
that they are limited to the geographic area. Furthermore, functions to visualize the results are implemented.
