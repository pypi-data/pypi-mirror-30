ls.sampleproject
=================

This is the README file for the project.

The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_. It
will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as
the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for
that purpose.


Installation
-------------

Install the package.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install ls.sampleproject

--------------
ls.sampleproject is known to work with the following versions of Python.

======   ======   =======

I am aiming to support the latest version of each.  Older versions may be dropped without much notice.  Let me know if that is a problem for you.  Other versions may work - YMMV.
