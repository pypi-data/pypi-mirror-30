Description: Current state: **alpha**, yet API seems fine and mostly stable.
        
        In current version (0.5.x) new-high level API is introduced while older low-level API partially marked as deprecated.
        
        * Works on Python 3.4+
        * Has support for PostgreSQL via `aiopg`
        * Has support for MySQL via `aiomysql`
        * Single point for high-level async API
        * Drop-in replacement for sync code, sync will remain sync
        * Basic operations are supported
        * Transactions support is present, yet not heavily tested
