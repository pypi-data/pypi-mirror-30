    Creates a subdictionary given a list of keys and a dictionary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    keys : list
        Keys to extract from `dict_`.
    dict_ : dict
        The dictionary from which to extract values.

    Returns
    -------

        A dictionary whose elements are a subset of `dict_`'s.

    Raises

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}
