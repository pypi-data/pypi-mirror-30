# astroSQL - Database Tools for Astronomers
_Currently in development usable only by Filipenko Group._

Simple Python API and shell commands to access to existing astronomical MySQL database.

## Features
* **astroSQL** Python API:
  - [x] read SQL database (`get_by_basename`, `get_by_radec`)
  - [x] update SQL database (`dict2sql`, `text2sql`)
  - [x] SQL query using peewee ORM
* **astroSQL** Shell Command
  - [ ]  query SQL database to text-based file
  - [ ]  update SQL database with text-based file
 Â 
> - [ ] to be available 
> - [x] available

## Dependencies
* MySQL server
* [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (*necessary if conda environment are used*)

## Setup

1. Clone the project and pip install

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/ketozhang/astroSQL
    $ cd astroSQL
    $ pip install .
    ```

2. Edit the configuration file `config.yml` which is located in where pip installed this package `/path/to/site-package/`. You may also use short python method to do this:

    ```bash
    $ ls $(python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])")/astrosql
    ```

    In `config.yml` edit as necessary

    ```yml
    # Uncomment 'forward' if you want to place config.yml elsewhere, specify the file path (maybe `~/.astrosql/config.yml` ?)
    # forward: '/path/to/config.yml'

    # Comment out any unecessary lines, empty will be read
    mysql:
        host: 'localhost'
        user: 'username'
        password: ''
        database: 'database_name'
    ```

    > <span style="color:rgb(200,0,0)">WARNING:</span> Keep this file secure if password is written
