Quick install and how-to
========================

Local display of a Jupyter notebook running on a distant server

#. Install the lattest version of ``stackyter`` on you local machine::

     pip install stackyter
     
#. Install `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_ on your distant host if not done yet
#. Create a file with instructions to make Jupyter (and anything else
   you need) available (e.g, ``mysetup.sh``)
#. Run ``stackyter.py`` on your local machine::
	
     stackyter.py --host thehost --user myusername --mysetup /path/on/the/host/mysetup.sh
	
#. Copy/paste the given URL into your local browser to display Jupyter

Purpose
=======

This script allow you to run a jupyter notebook (or lab) on a distant
server while displaying it localy in your local brower. It can be used
by anyone and on any host using the ``--host`` and ``--mysetup``
options. The only prerequisite is that **Jupyter must be available on
the distant host for this script to work.**

Installation
============

Latest stable version can be installed with ``pip``::

  pip install stackyter
   
To upgrade to a newer version::

  pip install --upgrade stackyter

To install in a local directory::

   pip install --user stackyter            #  in your home directory
   pip install --prefix mypath stackyter   #  in 'mypath'


Usage
=====

.. code-block:: shell
   
   stackyter.py [options]

Then click on the green link given by ``stackyter``, as followed::
  
    Copy/paste this URL into your browser to run the notebook localy 
       http://localhost:20001/?token=38924c48136091ade71a597218f2722dc49c669d1430db41

``Ctrl-C`` will stop the Jupyter server and close the connection.

You can use the following set of options to adapt ``stackyter`` to
your personal case.


Optional arguments
==================

An option used on the command line will always overwrite the content
of the configuration file for the same option, if it exists. See the
next section for a description on how to use the configuration
file. Available options are::

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Name of the configuration to use, taken from your
                        default configuration file (~/.stackyter-config.yaml
                        or $STACKYTERCONFIG). Default if to use the
                        'default_config' defined in this file. The content of
                        the configuration file will be overwritten by any
                        given command line options. (default: None)
  -f CONFIGFILE, --configfile CONFIGFILE
                        Configuration file containing a set of option values.
                        The content of this file will be overwritten by any
                        given command line options. (default: None)
  -H HOST, --host HOST  Name of the target host. Allows you to connect to any
                        host on which Jupyter is available, or to avoid
                        conflit with the content of your $HOME/.ssh/config.
                        (default: None)
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        Your user name on the host. If not given, ssh will try
                        to figure it out from you ~/.ssh/config or will use
                        your local user name. (default: None)
  -w WORKDIR, --workdir WORKDIR
                        Your working directory on the host (default: None)
  -j JUPYTER, --jupyter JUPYTER
                        Either launch a jupiter notebook or a jupyter lab.
                        (default: notebook)
  --mysetup MYSETUP     Path to a setup file (on the host) that will be used
                        to set up the working environment. A Python
                        installation with Jupyter must be available to make
                        this work. (default: None)
  --runbefore RUNBEFORE
                        A list of extra commands to run BEFORE sourcing your
                        setup file. Coma separated for more than one commands,
                        or a list in the config file. (default: None)
  --runafter RUNAFTER   A list of extra commands to run AFTER sourcing your
                        setup file. Coma separated for more than one commands,
                        or a list in the config file. (default: None)
  -C, --compression     Activate ssh compression option (-C). (default: False)
  -S, --showconfig      Show all available configurations from your default
                        file and exit. (default: False)


Configuration file
==================

A configuration dictionnary can contain any options available through
the command line. The options found in the configuration file will
always be overwritten by the command line.

The configuration file can be given in different ways, and can
contains from a single configuration dictionnary to several
configuration dictionnaries:

- The **configuration file** can either be a default file located
  under ``~/stackyter-config.yaml`` or defined by the
  ``STACKYTERCONFIG``, or given in command line using the
  ``--configfile`` option.

- The **configuration name**, which should be defined in your
  configuration file, must be given using the command line option
  ``--config``. If not given, a ``default_config``, which should be
  defined in your configration file, will be used by default.

Here are a few example on how to use it::

  stackyter.py  # 'default_config' in default file if it exists, default option values used otherwise
  stackyter.py --config config1  # 'config1' in default file which must exist
  stackyter.py --config config2 --configfile myfile.yaml  # 'config2' in 'myfile.yaml'
  stackyter.py --configfile myfile.yaml  # 'default_config' in 'myfile.yaml'

In principal, your default configuration file should look like that::

  {
   'default_config': 'host1',
  
   'host1': {
             'host': 'myhost.domain.fr',  # 'myhost' if you have configured your ~/.ssh/config
             'jupyter': 'lab',            # if installed
             'username': 'myusername',
             'mysetup': '/path/to/my/setup/file.sh',
             'workdir': '/path/to/my/directory/'
              },
  
   'host2': {
             'host': 'otherhost.fr',
             'username': 'otherusername',
             'mysetup': '/path/to/my/setup'
            },

   'host3': {
             'host': 'somewhere.edu',
             'username': 'ausername',
	     # Jupyter is available by default on this host, 'mysetup' is not needed
            },  
  }

or simply as followed if only one configuration is defined::

  {
   'host1': {
             'host': 'myhost.domain.fr',  # or 'myhost' if you have configured your ~/.ssh/config file
             'jupyter': 'lab',  # if installed
             'username': 'myusername',
             'mysetup': '/path/to/my/setup/file.sh',
             'workdir': '/path/to/my/directory/'
              },
  }

You can use the `example
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolaschotard/stackyter/master/configs/example-config.yaml>`_
configuration file as a template to create your own. You can also find
several example configuration files in the `configs
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolaschotard/stackyter/master/configs>`_
directory for different user cases.


Distant host configuration
==========================

The ``--host`` option allows you to connect to any distant host. The
default option used to create the ``ssh`` tunnel are ``-X -Y -tt
-L``. If you want to configure your ``ssh`` connection, edit your
``~/.ssh/config`` file using, for instance, the following template::

  Host myjupyter
  Hostname thehostname
  User myusername
  GSSAPIClientIdentity myusername@HOST
  GSSAPIAuthentication yes
  GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes
  GSSAPITrustDns yes

Ypu only need to replace ``thehostname``, ``myusername``, and
``myusername@HOST`` by the appropriate values. You can then use the
``stackyter`` script as follows::

  stackyter.py --host myjupyter

Or put the value for that option (along with others) in your
``config.yaml`` file. 

Working environment
===================

There are several ways to setup your personnal working environment,
using the ``--mysetup``, ``--runbefore``, and ``runafter``
options. Given a setup file located on your distant host, you can
simply do::

  stackyter.py --mysetup /path/to/my/setup.sh (--username myusername)

Your local setup file will be sourced at connection as followed::

  source /path/to/my/setup.sh

The ``runbefore`` and ``runafter`` options allow you to respectively
run command lines before or after your setup file is sourced. It can
be useful if you need to pass argument to your setup file through
environment variables, or add extra command after the sourcing.

Your setup must **at least** contains what is needed to make
Jupyter available. If Jupyter is available by default on the distant
host (it might be set up on connection), you only need to use the
``--host`` and ``--username`` option to run.

You can of course add any kind of personal setups with these three
options, related of not to Jupyter.

Help
====

- If you have any comments or suggestions, or if you find a bug,
  please use the dedicated github `issue tracker
  <https://github.com/nicolaschotard/stackyter/issues>`_.
- Why ``stakyter``? For historical reason: ``stackyter`` = LSST
  ``stack`` + ``Jupyter``. It was initially intended for LSST members
  to easily use the LSST software stack and interact with data sets.
