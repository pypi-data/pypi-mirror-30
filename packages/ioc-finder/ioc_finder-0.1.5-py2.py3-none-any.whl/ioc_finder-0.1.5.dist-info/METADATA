        Find `indicators of compromise <https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Indicators-of-Compromise-IOC>`_ in text.
        
        Capabilities
        ============
        
        Currently, this package can the following items in a given text:
        
        - IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)
        - Email addresses (both standard format (e.g. ``test@example.com``) and an email with an IP address as the domain (e.g. ``test@[192.168.0.1]``))
        - Hosts (including unicode domain names (e.g. ``È©xample.com``))
        - URLs
        - File Hashes (sha256, sha1, and md5)
        
        Also provides some helpful features like:
        
        - Ability to remove an indicator type after it is parsed - For example, this is helpful if you do not want to parse the host name from a URL. You can setup IOC Finder to remove all URLs from the text after it parses them.
        - Ability to set order in which IOCs are parsed
