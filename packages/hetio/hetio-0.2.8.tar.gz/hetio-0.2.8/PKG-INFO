Description: Hetnets in Python
        =================
        
        |Latest DOI| |GitHub issues| |Build Status|
        
        Background
        ----------
        
        **Hetnets**: Hetnets, also
        `called <https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d104>`__ *heterogeneous
        information networks*, are graphs with multiple node and edge types.
        Hetnets are both multipartite and multirelational. They provide a
        scalable, intuitive, and frictionless structure for data integration.
        
        **Purpose**: This package provides data structures for hetnets and
        algorithms for `edge prediction <http://het.io/hnep/>`__. It only
        supports hetnets, which is its primary advantage compared to other
        network software. Node/edge attributes and edge directionality are
        supported.
        
        **Impetus**: Development originated with a
        `study <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004259>`__ to predict
        disease-associated genes and continues with a successive
        `study <https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26726>`__ to repurpose drugs.
        
        **Caution**: Documentation is currently spotty, testing coverage is
        moderate, and the API is not fully stable. Contributions are welcome.
        Please use `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/dhimmel/hetio/issues>`__
        for feedback, questions, or troubleshooting.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        |PyPI|
        
        Please use Python 3.4 or higher. To install the current PyPI version
        (recommended), run:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            pip install hetio
        
        For the latest GitHub version, run:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/dhimmel/hetio.git#egg=hetio
        
        For development, clone or download-and-extract the repository. Then run
        ``pip install --editable .`` from the repository's root directory. The
        ``--editable`` flag specifies
        `editable <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#development-mode>`__
        mode, so updating the source updates your installation.
        
        Once installed, tests can be executed by running ``py.test test/`` from
        the repository's root directory.
        
        Design
        ------
        
        A Graph object stores a heterogeneous network and relies on the
        following classes:
        
        1. Graph
        2. MetaGraph
        3. Edge
        4. MetaEdge
        
        Release instructions
        --------------------
        
        This section is only relevant for project maintainers. Travis CI
        deployments are used to upload releases to
        `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/hetio>`__ and `GitHub
        releases <https://github.com/dhimmel/hetio/releases>`__. To create a new
        release, do the following:
        
        1. Bump the version in ```__init__.py`` <hetio/__init__.py>`__.
        
        2. Add a release notes file in ```release-notes`` <release-notes>`__.
           Format as a commit message that will be used as the GitHub release
           description.
        
        3. Run the following commands:
        
        ``sh   TAG=v`python setup.py --version`   git add hetio/__init__.py release-notes/$TAG.*   git commit --message "Upgrade to $TAG"   git push   git tag --annotate $TAG --file release-notes/$TAG.*   git push --tags``
        
        4. Recommended: Edit the GitHub release to improve formating and add a
           Zenodo badge.
