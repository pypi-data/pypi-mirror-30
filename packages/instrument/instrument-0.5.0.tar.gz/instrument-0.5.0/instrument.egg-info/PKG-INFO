Description: instrument
        ==========
        
        `instrument <http://github.com/wearpants/instrument>`__ provides instrumentation primitives for metrics and benchmarking. It can be used to:
        
        * monitor runtime behavior in production systems
        * conduct performance benchmarks
        * easily generate plots/graphs and statistics
        
        Get it from PyPI today:
        
          `pip install instrument`
        
        Python `Instrument` was formerly known as `Measure It`.
