        Notes
        -----
        Creating a :func:`write` function for the Bbcontacts parser
        would come with a lot of issues, such as the parallel/antiparallel
        direction, scoring etc.

        Thus, no :func:`write` method is available.

        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
           Write function not available

        """
        raise NotImplementedError("Write function not available")
