# Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>If its not working</summary>

`modprobe snd-aloop`

This command MUST be successful, Sound Loopback Kernel Module MUST be up & running,
if it fails you dont have Sound Loopback Kernel Module up & running,
if it says `modprobe: FATAL: Module aloop not found ...` it failed,
please check your Distro Documentation about Sound Loopback Kernel Module to fix it,
sometimes you need to enable it, or recompile it, or reinstall it, or whatever
(that is not my Bug, complain to your Distro).
