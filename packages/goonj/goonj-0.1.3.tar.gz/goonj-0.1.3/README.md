# Goonj  (WORK In Progress -- Comming Soon!!)
A python library to enable easy alerting services across multiple channels.

## Requirement

### What?
A library that can communicate with any alerting channel like Email, SMS, Slack etc..
A library that can generate reports by aggregating information and sending an alert when it crosses customizable thresholds.

### Why?
We often raise alerts from code. Sometimes these alerts require some processing themselves which litter the actual code.
Getting an aggregated alert allows us to determine if there are any major breakages in the product and act on them quickly. It also allows us to determine the severity of the alert in case weâ€™re getting a lot of them through the day.
