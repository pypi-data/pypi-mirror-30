        FOOOF: Fitting Oscillations & One-Over F
        ========================================
        
        FOOOF is a fast, efficient, physiologically-informed model to parameterize
        neural power spectra, characterizing both the 1/f background, and overlying
        peaks (putative oscillations).
        
        The model conceives of the neural power spectrum as consisting of two distinct functional processes:
        - A 1/f background, modeled with an exponential fit, with:
        - Band-limited peaks rising above this background (modeled as Gaussians).
        
        With regards to examing peaks in the frequency domain, as putative oscillations, the benefit
        of the FOOOF approach is that these peaks are characterized in terms of their specific center
        frequency, amplitude and bandwidth without requiring predefining specific bands of interest.
        In particular, it separates these peaks from a dynamic, and independently interesting 1/f
        background. This conception of the 1/f as potentially functional (and therefore worth carefully
        modeling) is based on work from the Voytek lab and others that collectively shows that 1/f changes
        across task demands and participant demographics, and that it may index underlying
        excitation/inhibition (EI) balance.
