Description: |Build Status| |Coveralls Status|
        
        This is a port of the
        `Supervisor-logging <https://github.com/infoxchange/supervisor-logging>`__
        project. Along with capturing loglines, as Supervisor-logging does, it's
        also intended to capture the
        `PROCESS_STATE <http://supervisord.org/events.html#event-listeners-and-event-notifications>`__
        events that Supervisor emits.
        
        supervisor-logstash-notifier
        ============================
        
        A `supervisor <http://supervisord.org/>`__ plugin to stream events & logs to a
        Logstash instance.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Python 2.7 or Python 3.4+ is required.
        
        ::
        
            pip install supervisor-logstash-notifier
        
        Note that Supervisor itself does not yet work on Python 3, though it can
        be installed in a separate environment (because
        supervisor-logstash-notifier is a separate process).
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The Logstash instance to send the events to is configured with the
        environment variables:
        
        -  ``LOGSTASH_SERVER``
        -  ``LOGSTASH_PORT``
        -  ``LOGSTASH_PROTO``
        
        Add the plugin as an event listener:
        
        ::
        
            # Capture state changes
            [eventlistener:logging]
            command = logstash_notifier
            events = PROCESS_STATE
        
            # Capture stdout/stderr
            [eventlistener:logging]
            command = logstash_notifier --capture-output
            events = PROCESS_LOG
        
            # Capture state changes and stdout/stderr
            [eventlistener:logging]
            command = logstash_notifier --capture-output
            events = PROCESS_STATE,PROCESS_LOG
        
        If you don't wish to define the environment variables for the entire
        shell, you can pass them in via Supervisor's configuration:
        
        ::
        
            [eventlistener:logging]
            environment=LOGSTASH_SERVER="127.0.0.1",LOGSTASH_PORT="12201",LOGSTASH_PROTO="tcp"
            command=logstash_notifier
            events=PROCESS_STATE
            
        Enable the log events in your program:
        
        ::
        
            [program:yourprogram]
            stdout_events_enabled = true
            stderr_events_enabled = true
        
        Advanced Usage
        --------------
        
        It is also possible to include environment variables in the event messages,
        by specifying the name of the environment variables to include:
        
        ::
        
            [eventlistener:logging]
            command=export IPV4=`ec2metadata --local-ipv4`; logstash_notifier --include IPV4
            events=PROCESS_STATE
        
        Or alternatively, by specifying arbitrary keyvals of data to log:
        
        ::
        
            [eventlistener:logging]
            command=logstash_notifier --include bears="polar,brown,black" notbears="unicorn,griffin,sphinx,otter"
            events=PROCESS_STATE
        
        These two forms of arbitrary user data inclusion can be combined, and used together
        if necessary.
        
        Running with Logstash
        ---------------------
        
        Logstash can be simply configured to receive events:
        
        ::
        
            input {
                tcp {
                    port => 12201
                    codec => json
                }
            }
        
            output {
                stdout {
                    codec => rubydebug
                }
            }
        
        The JSON produced by the events and log output will look like this:
        
        ::
        
            # State changes
            {
              "@timestamp": "2016-03-28T23:58:03.469Z",

            }
        
            # Log output
            {
              "@timestamp": "2016-03-28T23:58:03.741Z",
              "@version": "1",
