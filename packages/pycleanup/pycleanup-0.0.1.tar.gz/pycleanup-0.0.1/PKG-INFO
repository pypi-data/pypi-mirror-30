Description: # pyclean
        Clean up your working directory.
        
        # Why?
        Everyone uses commands like
        ```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
        find . -name \*.pyc -delete
        ```
        or
        ```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
        find . -name "*.pyc" -exec rm -f {} \;
        ```
        but I often switch me OS from Linux to Windows. Fist I would wrote different
        scrips, but a python package is much nicer.
        
        # Install
        Uses pip to install.
        ```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
        pip install pyclear
        ```
        
        # Uses
        As command-line tool.
        ```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
        pyclear --help
        ```
        or
        ```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
        python -m pyclear --help
        ```
        
        As python function
        ```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
        from pyclean.func import cleanup
        dir = '.'
        args = {'cache': True, 'egg': True}
        
        cleanup(dir, args)
        ```
