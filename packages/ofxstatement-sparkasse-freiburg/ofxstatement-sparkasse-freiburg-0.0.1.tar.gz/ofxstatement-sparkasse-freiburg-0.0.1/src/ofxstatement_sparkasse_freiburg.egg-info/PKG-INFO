Description: # ofxstatement plugin for Sparkasse Freiburg-Nördlicher Breisgau
        
        This is an ofxstatement plugin for the German bank Sparkasse
        Freiburg-Nördlicher Breisgau (short: Sparkasse Freiburg).
        
        This plugin has no affiliation with or endorsement by [Sparkasse
        Freiburg-Nördlicher Breisgau](https://www.sparkasse-freiburg.de/). The only
        reason for using the name is to aid people looking for a tool to convert that
        bank's CSV transaction exports to OFX.
        
        [ofxstatement](https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement) is a tool to convert
        proprietary bank statement to OFX format, suitable for importing to GnuCash.
        Plugin for ofxstatement parses a particular proprietary bank statement format
        and produces common data structure, that is then formatted into an OFX file.
        
        Users of ofxstatement have developed several plugins for their banks. They are
        listed on the main [ofxstatement](https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement) site.
        If your bank is missing, you can develop your own plugin.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use this plugin install it. For example:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install --user ofxstatement-sparkasse-freiburg
        ```
        
        Edit the configuration:
        
        ```bash
        ofxstatement edit-config
        ```
        
        Add something like this:
        
        ```
        [sparkasse_freiburg]
        plugin = germany_sparkasse_freiburg
        account = 123456789
        ```
        
        *account* is you bank account number (Kontonummer).
        
        Then download the CSV files (CSV-CAMT format) from you online banking account
        and convert it as follows:
        
        ```bash
        ofxstatement convert -t sparkasse_freiburg EXAMPLE.csv EXAMPLE.ofx
        ```
        
        The resulting .ofx file can then be imported in gnuCash or similar software.
        
        **Note:** Beware that some things (such as balance calculation) were left out
        because they are not needed by gnuCash. Open a ticket or send a pull request if
        something is missing for your use case.
        
        
        ## Setting up development environment
        
        It is recommended to use *virtualenv* to make a clean development environment.
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/omarkohl/ofxstatement-sparkasse-freiburg
        cd ofxstatement-sparkasse-freiburg
        make venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        This will download all the dependencies and install them into your virtual
        environment. After this, you should be able to do::
        
        ```bash
        ofxstatement list-plugins
        ```
        
        Expected output:
        
        ```
        The following plugins are available:
