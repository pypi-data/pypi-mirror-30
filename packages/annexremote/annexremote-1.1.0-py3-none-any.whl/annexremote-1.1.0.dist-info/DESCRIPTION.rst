Helper module to easily develop special remotes for git annex.
AnnexRemote handles all the protocol stuff for you, so you can focus on the remote itself.
It implements the complete external special remote protocol and fulfils all specifications regarding whitespaces etc.
Changes to the protocol are normally adopted within hours after they've been published without changing 
the interface for the remote.
