        ## Description
        **EZyRB** is a python library for the Model Order Reduction based on **baricentric triangulation** for the selection of the parameter points and on **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition** for the selection of the modes. It is ideally suited for actual industrial problems, since its structure can interact with several simulation software simply providing the output file of the simulations. Up to now, it handles files in the vtk and mat formats. It has been used for the model order reduction of problems solved with matlab and openFOAM.
        
        See the [**Examples**](#examples) section below and the **Tutorials** to have an idea of the potential of this package.
        
        ## Dependencies and installation
        **EZyRB** requires `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`. They can be easily installed via `pip`. Moreover **EZyRB** depends on `vtk`. These requirements cannot be satisfied through `pip`.
        Please see the table below for instructions on how to satisfy the requirements.
        
        | Package | Version  | Comment                                                                    |
        |---------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | vtk     | >= 5.0   | Simplest solution is `conda install vtk`                                   |
        
        The official distribution is on GitHub, and you can clone the repository using
        
        ```bash
        > git clone https://github.com/mathLab/EZyRB
        ```
        
        To install the package just type:
        
        ```bash
        > python setup.py install
        ```
        
        To uninstall the package you have to rerun the installation and record the installed files in order to remove them:
        
        ```bash
        > python setup.py install --record installed_files.txt
        > cat installed_files.txt | xargs rm -rf
        ```
        
        
        ## Documentation
        **EZyRB** uses [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) for code documentation. To build the html versions of the docs simply:
        
        ```bash
        > cd docs
        > make html
        ```
        
        The generated html can be found in `docs/build/html`. Open up the `index.html` you find there to browse.
        
        
        ## Testing
        We are using Travis CI for continuous intergration testing. You can check out the current status [here](https://travis-ci.org/mathLab/EZyRB).
        
        To run tests locally:
        
        ```bash
        > python test.py
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Examples
        
        You can find useful tutorials on how to use the package in the `tutorials` folder.

        ## How to contribute
        We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
        just a few small guidelines you need to follow.
        
        ### Submitting a patch
        
          1. It's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or
             feature you're intending to fix.  Even if you think it's relatively minor,
             it's helpful to know what people are working on.  Mention in the initial
             issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can
             be assigned to you.
        
          2. Follow the normal process of [forking][] the project, and setup a new
             branch to work in.  It's important that each group of changes be done in
             separate branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the
             commits related to that bug or feature.
        
          3. To ensure properly formatted code, please make sure to use 4
             spaces to indent the code. The easy way is to run on your bash the provided
             script: ./code_formatter.sh. You should also run [pylint][] over your code.
             It's not strictly necessary that your code be completely "lint-free",
             but this will help you find common style issues.
        
          4. Any significant changes should almost always be accompanied by tests.  The
             project already has good test coverage, so look at some of the existing
             tests if you're unsure how to go about it. We're using [coveralls][] that
             is an invaluable tools for seeing which parts of your code aren't being
             exercised by your tests.
        
          5. Do your best to have [well-formed commit messages][] for each change.
             This provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit
             messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools.
        
          6. Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a [pull request][]. Please,
             remember to rebase properly in order to maintain a clean, linear git history.
