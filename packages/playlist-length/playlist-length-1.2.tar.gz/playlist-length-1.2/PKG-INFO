Description: # Playlist Length
        
        A command-line tool to calculation the length of all the vidoes in a directory
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        **ffmpeg** package is required for this package to work, so you need to get it installed on your system
        
        To install ffmpeg on ubuntu
        
        ```
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
        sudo apt-get install frei0r-plugins
        ```
        
        For other OS read instruction [here](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-FFmpeg)
        
        
        ## Installing
        hit up your terminal and type following command
        
        ```
        $ pip install --user playlist-length
        ```
        
        or
        ```
        $ pip install --user -e git+https://github.com/karansthr/playlist-length#egg=playlist-length
        ```
        
        
        if your ~/.local/bin/ is not in PATH then run
        ```
        $ export PATH=$PATH:${HOME}/.local/bin/
        ```
        
        you may add above line of code in ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc etc. to repeat above step every time a terminal is opened.
        
        To get length of all the videos in a directory, use following command
        ```
        $ playlistlen -p path_to_directory
        ```
        
        or use following command for current directory
        ```
        $ playlistlen
        ```
        
        By default it will look for subdirectories in the given directory, if you want it to look for only files in the given directory only, then use **--no-subdir** flag, for example
        ```
        $ playlistlen -p path_to_directory --no-subdir
        ```
        
        for help use -h or --help, for example
        ```
        $ playlistlen --help
        ```
