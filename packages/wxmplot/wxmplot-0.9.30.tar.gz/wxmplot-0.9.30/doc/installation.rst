Downloading and Installation
====================================

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The wxmplot package requires wxpython, matplotlib, numpy, and six.
Matplotlib version 1.5 or higher is required, with version 2.0 or higher is
strongly recommended.

With wxPython 4.0, (and wxPython Phoenix 3.0.2 or later), wxmplot works
with Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6.  Testing with wxPython 4.0 and Python 3.5
and 3.6 has been limited, but all functionality appears to work well.
