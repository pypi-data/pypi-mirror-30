VERSION_HISTORY = """

- 0.1.4 (2017-03-14): released.

- 0.1.5 (2017-04-11): added facility to process only sessions found in a
  manually curated master table.
  Table name is SessionsForAutonomicAnalysis (q.v.), which needs the same
    - DateTimeCode
    - Subject
    - Box
  columns as the Config table.

- 0.1.6 (2017-04-11): removed one incorrect assertion from
  TrialTiming.__init__()
  
- 0.1.7 (2017-04-29): define CS/US timing from database, rather than hard-coded
  - Added ChunkDurationSec (float) to SessionsForAutonomicAnalysis table.
  - So, creation SQL is:
  
    CREATE TABLE SessionsForAutonomicAnalysis (
        DateTimeCode DATETIME NOT NULL,
        Subject VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
        Box INT NOT NULL,
        ChunkDurationSec FLOAT NOT NULL
    );
    
    and a quick population command is:
    
    INSERT INTO SessionsForAutonomicAnalysis (
        DateTimeCode,
        Subject,
        Box,
        ChunkDurationSec
    )
    SELECT
        DateTimeCode,
        Subject,
        Box,
        10.0
    FROM Config;

  - Bugfixes for zero-length slices.

- 0.1.8 (2017-05-01): changed the definition of how baseline/CS are split
  into chunks. See StimulusLockedTelemetry.init().
  
- 0.1.9 (2017-05-04): changes to definition of "baseline" by Laith; see
  aversive_pavlovian_database.py
  
- 0.2.0 (2018-03-08): changes for HFC
    - alternative input formats considered: textual output from old 
      AversivePavlovian code by Katrin. ***
    - whole-session analysis
    - R-R interval output files, as input to Kubios for cross-check
    - cope with the fact that Spike sometimes produces its RRint; see below and
      gen_telemetry()
    - also renamed stimulus_bp.py to main.py

EXAMPLE OF SPIKE FILE WITH RR INTERVAL IN SECONDS
e.g. Parsnip_Cueprobe_21May15_peak.txt

Time	RRint	Heartrate	Time	Systolic	Time	Diastolic
0.025600	0.025600	2343.750000	0.025600	149.496460	0.188780	104.180908

- 0.3.0 (2018-03-18):
  - Inconsistency with Kubios.
    Was because we were using population SDs (the default via Numpy) whereas
    sample SDs are what Kubios is using.
    Default changed. Old method still available via
            --calcmethod POP_SD
    New test option:
            --test_calc
            
- 0.3.1 (2018-03-18):
  - Compensating for odd ignore-first-IBI behaviour of the HRV Toolkit.
  - See notes in cardiac_calcs.py, and 
        --hrvtk_dummy_initial_beat [default]
        --hrvtk_no_dummy_initial_beat [mimic old behaviour]
