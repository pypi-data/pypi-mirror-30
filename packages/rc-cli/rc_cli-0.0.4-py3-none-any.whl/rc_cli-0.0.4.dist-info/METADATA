# RoseCloud CLI
The RoseCloud CLI tool. It is intended to be used to setup and manage
a RoseCloud workspace for instructors and teaching assistants.

## Requirements
- python 3.5+

## Development
### Setup
  1. Install `pipenv`: `sudo pip install pipenv`.
  2. Run `pipenv install`.
This sets up a python virtual environment for you. All subsequent
commands should be run via `pipenv run ...`. If you need to add
another dependency, run `pipenv install <package_name>`.

### Link CLI
  1. Run `pipenv install -e .`. This will create a symlink to this
project. All changes here will show up in the `pipenv`.
  2. Run `pipenv run rc`.

**Note**: If you do not want to use `pipenv` or do not like the idea
of prefixing `pipenv run` for all commands, you can run `pipenv`
with `pip install -e .`

## Publishing
### Setup
First, you need to install `PyPi`'s publication tool `twine`.
Run,
```
pip install twine
```

You will also need `wheel`.
Run,
```
pip install wheel
```

You will need to also setup a PyPi account ([link](https://pypi.org/account/register/))
and a test PyPi account ([link](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/)).

For ease of use, you can create a file in your home directory called
`.pypirc` with the following. For linux and osx, this would be `~/.pypirc`. `Twine` will use this to request rather than
requesting for credentials.
```
[pypi]
username = <username>
password = <password>

[testpypi]
username = <username>
password = <password>
```

### Generating Dist Files
**Before you begin, make sure `python` has version 3.5+. The following command will
generate dist files that are specific to your `python` version and some of the features
used in this project are `python 3.5+` specific.**

To generate `dist` files, you need to run
```
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

### Upload New Distribution
If you are uploading changes, you should update the version in the `setup.py` following
semantic versioning principles.

Run the following to upload latest changes to official `PyPi` servers
```
twine upload dist/*
```

You can now install it using
```
pip install rc-cli
```

Alternatively, to test without messing with production, run this
```
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```

To install from test,
```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/rc-cli rc-cli
```
