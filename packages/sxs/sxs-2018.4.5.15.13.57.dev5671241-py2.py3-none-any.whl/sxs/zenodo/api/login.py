class Login(object):

    def __init__(self, sandbox=False, access_token=None, access_token_path=None, session=None):
        """Initialize a Login object for interacting with zenodo

        This object encapsulates the credentials needed to interact with the Zenodo API, and exposes
        a Session object that can be used to make requests which automatically include the
        credentials.  It can be used for generic requests, but note that other objects in this
        module make certain tasks easier -- such as creating or modifying a "deposit", which is
        Zenodo's name for a new upload.  The Deposit object should be created from this object.

        These actions require a Zenodo API access token.  These are obtained from the website --
        either
            https://zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/tokens/new/
        or
            https://sandbox.zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/tokens/new/
        Note that zenodo.org and sandbox.zenodo.org use separate login systems and separate access
        tokens.  The access token may either be passed as a string to this function (though that
        means it will probably be found in some script file somewhere, which is probably not a good
        idea for security), or can be read from a file.  By default the file from which the token is
        read is '~/.credentials/zenodo/access_token' or the same name with '_sandbox' appended.
        Thus, it is probably easiest to simply place your access tokens in those files, so that no
        arguments need to be passed to this function.  As a basic security measure, please ensure
        that those files are not readable by anyone but the user.


        Parameters
        ==========
        sandbox: bool [default: False]
            If True, use the zenodo sandbox site, which is intended solely for testing purposes.
            This site is cleaned out regularly, so you cannot expect any entry to be here for very
            long.

        access_token: string or None [default: None]
            If present this is used as the Zenodo API access token.

        access_token_path: string or None [default: None]
            If `access_token` is not given, this file is read and the first line is used as the
            access token.  If this argument is None, it defaults to either
            '~/.credentials/zenodo/access_token' for the regular website or
            '~/.credentials/zenodo/access_token_sandbox' for the sandbox website.

        session: requests.Session or None [default: None]
            This is the object that handles all of the requests made to the API.  If `None`, a
            Session is created for you, and sensible default headers (including the access token)
            are created.  If you need to adjust some of the Session parameters like proxies or SSL
            verification, you can simply create your own and pass it in here.  Remember to set the
            access token using a header like
                {"Authorization": "Bearer <YourAccessTokenHere>"}
