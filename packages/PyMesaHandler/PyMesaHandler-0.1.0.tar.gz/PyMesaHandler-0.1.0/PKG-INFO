Description: # PyMesaHandler ![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/muma7490/PyMesaHandler.svg?branch=master)
        PyMesHandler allows for a native interaction of inlist
        files via Python. This means, that the package will
        automatically convert between the fortran like variables
        within inlist and native python standard datatypes. For
        example the variable
        ```fortran
        read_extra_star_job_inlist1 = .true.
        ```
        will be available through the package as
        ```python
        mesaHandlerObject["read_extra_star_job_inlist1"] = True
        ```
        
        The conversion happens in a black box using some regex
        magic automatically. This means if you change a property
        in the python object, it will automatically transfer to
        the file.
        
        Keep in mind this application is still a work in progress.
        If you find any errors or have a feature request, don't
        hesitate to open an issue on this github.
        
        ## Features
        - **No more file hassle**. PyMesaHandler automatically
        combines all files you use for your setup and will
        update them accordingly
        - **Python file types**. You can actually do some scripting
        or calculation beforehand. The package will automatically
        convert these properly to the right types for fortran.
        - **Parameter creation and deletion**: Currently the module only allows
        for access of already existing parameters. This will
        include checks if the parameter actually exists within Mesa.
        ## Getting started
        PyMesaHandler is available through pip. To install simply
        call
        ```
        pip install PyMesaHandler
        ```
        ## Usage example
        Lets say you want to edit the initial mass of the model
        you want to create. Simply create a python file
        in the same directory as the inlist files with the
        following code
        ```python
        from MesaHandler import MesaAccess
        
        object = MesaAccess()
        
        object["initial_mass"] = 5
        ```
        and run it. **Thats it**. The file will now have the
        changed mass as its parameter.
        
        ## Future development
        There are many features that are aimed to be added to this
        module. The goal is to create a package, where you no
        longer need to manually run Mesa, so that you can automate
        your usage of Mesa. Features for the pipeline are:
        
        - **Automated Build & run for Mesa**: The modul will run
        Mesa if you want to run it through the module
        - **Plotting capabilities**: You want to plot one
        or multiple results from Mesa? That will be also possible
        through this package.
        
        And various other features that are not yet included.
