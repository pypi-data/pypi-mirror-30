Release Notes
=============

Here is an example of the release statistics for ipywidgets 7.0.

It has been 157 days since the last release. In this release, we closed [127 issues](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A7.0) and [216 pull requests](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A7.0+is%3Aclosed) with [1069](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/compare/6.0.0...7.0.0) commits, of which 851 are not merges.

Here are some commands used to generate some of the statistics above.

```
# merges since in 6.0.0, but not 7.0.0, which is a rough list of merged PRs
git log --merges 6.0.0...master --pretty=oneline

# To really make sure we get all PRs, we could write a program that
# pulled all of the PRs, examined a commit in each one, and did
# `git tag --contains <commit number>` to see if that PR commit is included
# in a previous release.

# issues closed with no milestone in the time period
# is:issue is:closed closed:"2016-07-14 .. 2017-02-28"

# date of 6.0.0 tag
git show -s --format=%cd --date=short 6.0.0^{commit}

# Non-merge commits in 7.0.0 not in any 6.x release
git log --pretty=oneline --no-merges ^6.0.0 master | wc -l

# Authors of non-merge commits
git shortlog -s  6.0.0..master --no-merges | cut -c8- | sort -f

# New committers: authors unique in the 6.0.0..7.0.0 logs, but not in the 6.0.0 log
comm -23 <(git shortlog -s -n 6.0.0..master --no-merges | cut -c8- | sort) <(git shortlog -s -n 6.0.0 --no-merges | cut -c8- | sort) | sort -f
```
