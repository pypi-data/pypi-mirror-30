Description: Python Remote Execution (PREX)
        
        This is an experimental server that executes Python scripts (or any kind of
        scripts, really) it receives over a websocket connection. The connection allows
        a web client to launch and interact with Python programs in real-time. 
        
        The main use-case scenario is to enable a client device running a web browser,
        such as a smart phone or ChromeBook, to execute Python scripts in a natural
        way.
        
        Please do _NOT_ run the server on your personal computer! Allowing clients to
        run Python scripts from web apps is highly insecure. You have been warned!
