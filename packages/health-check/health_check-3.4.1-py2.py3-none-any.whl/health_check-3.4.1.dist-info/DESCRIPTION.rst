Health Check is an application that provides an API to check the health status of some parts and some utilities like
ping requests. This application can works as standalone or included in a Django project.

This application defines the following terms:

Provider
    Function that does a quick check or stats gathering and returns a json serializable value, such as dict, list or
    simple types.

Resource
    A service or functionality whose status needs to be known.

Said this, providers are grouped by resources. So you can use resource as a simple group, or as a component of your
application. E.g: A resource that represents your database with some checks over it, such as simple ping, check if your
application tables are created, if it contains data...

Quick start
===========

1. Install this package using pip:

.. code:: bash

    pip install health-check

2. *(Django)* Add *PROJECT_PATH* to your django settings module.
3. *(Django)* Add *health_check* to your **INSTALLED_APPS** settings like this:

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'health_check',
    )

4. *(Django)* Add **Health Check** urls to your project urls:

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r'^health/', include('health_check.urls')),
    ]

Check Providers
===============
Health Check provides a mechanism to add new custom check functions through **check providers**. Each check provider
will generate a new API method with an URL that uses the name of the provider. These functions must accept \*args and
\*\*kwargs and will return a JSON-serializable object through json.dumps() method, for example a ping function:

.. code:: python

    def ping(*args, **kwargs):
        return {'pong': True}

By default **Health Check** provides the follow checks:

Ping
    A ping to application.

    URL: `/api/health/ping`

Databases
    Check if databases are running.

    URL: `/api/health/databases`

Caches
    Check if caches are running.

    URL: `/api/health/caches`

Celery
    Check if celery workers defined in settings are running.

    URL: `/api/health/celery`

Databases stats
    Show stats for all databases.

    URL: `/api/stats/databases`

Celery stats
    Show celery worker stats.

    URL: `/api/stats/celery`

Code
    Source code stats such as current active branch, last commit, if debug is active...

    URL: `/api/stats/code`

Run providers
=============
The main goal of this application is to provide an easy way to run checks over defined resources, so there are different
ways to do it.

Command
-------
Health Check provides a command to query current health of a resource. This command can be call as:

.. code:: bash

    health_check {resource} [options]

Call a specific provider from a resource:

.. code:: bash

    health_check {resource} {provider} [options]

To get current status of health checks, and exit with an error if some check is failing:

.. code:: bash

    health_check health -e

Each resource has its own set of options that can be displayed through command help:

.. code:: bash

    health_check -h

Code
----
To run all providers of a specific resource:

.. code:: python

    from health_check.providers import Resource

    resource = Resource('resource_name')
    providers_result = resource()

A single provider can be executed:

.. code:: python

    from health_check.providers import Provider

    provider = Provider('path.to.provider_function')
    provider_result = provider()

Django
======
Health check adds some useful behavior to your Django application.

Health Check website
--------------------
A website that shows Health Check data is available in this application. It's possible access to follow URLs to get a
detailed view of your system health status. Those three pages will show results of providers configured (as explained in
settings section)::

    http://www.website.com/health/
    http://www.website.com/health/health/
    http://www.website.com/health/stats/

Health Check API
----------------
Health Check API can be used as a standalone application including only their urls:

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r'^health/', include('health.api.urls')),
    ]

This API have a single url for each provider, that are grouped by resources.
Each provider can be queried alone, returning his current health status::

    http://your_domain/health/api/health/ping

Also there is a resource view that will return the health status of all providers::

    http://your_domain/health/api/health

For last, there is a root view that will return the health status of all providers from all resources::

    http://your_domain/health/api

Django management commands
--------------------------
Previous command can be used as Django management command:

.. code:: bash

    python manage.py health_check {resource} {provider} [options]

Settings
========
Health check settings can be added directly to Django settings module or create an specific module for them. If a
custom module (or class) is used, you must specify it through **HEALTH_CHECK_SETTINGS** environment variable.

To use a custom module for settings is necessary to specify the full path: *project.package.settings*. The same applies
to objects: *project.package.settings:SettingsObject*.

health_check_providers
----------------------
List of additional check providers. Each provider consists in a tuple of name, function complete path, args and kwargs.

Example:

.. code:: python

    health_check_providers = {
        'resource': (
            ('test', 'application.module.test_function', [1, 2], {'foo': 'bar'}),
        )
    }

Default:

.. code:: python

    providers = getattr(settings, 'health_check_providers', {
        'health': (
            ('ping', 'health_check.providers.health.ping', None, None),
            ('databases', 'health_check.providers.django.health.databases', None, None),
            ('caches', 'health_check.providers.django.health.caches', None, None),
        ),
        'stats': (
            ('databases', 'health_check.providers.django.stats.databases', None, None),
            ('code', 'health_check.providers.stats.code', None, None),
        )
    }

health_check_celery_workers
---------------------------
List of hostname from celery workers to be checked. If any worker is defined, two additional providers listed previously
will be added to default set.

Default:

.. code:: python

    health_check_celery_workers = ()
