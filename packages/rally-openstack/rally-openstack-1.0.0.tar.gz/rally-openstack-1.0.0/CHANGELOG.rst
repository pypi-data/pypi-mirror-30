   Please leave these notes as much as possible human oriented.

    - **Added** for new features.
    - **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.
    - **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features/plugins.
    - **Removed** for now removed features/plugins.
    - **Fixed** for any bug fixes.

.. Release notes for existing releases are MUTABLE! If there is something that
   was missed or can be improved, feel free to change it!

[1.0.0] - 2018-03-28
--------------------
Start a fork of `rally/plugins/openstack module of original OpenStack Rally
project
<https://github.com/openstack/rally/tree/0.11.1/rally/plugins/openstack>`_

Added
~~~~~

* [scenario plugin] GnocchiArchivePolicy.list_archive_policy
* [scenario plugin] GnocchiArchivePolicy.create_archive_policy
* [scenario plugin] GnocchiArchivePolicy.create_delete_archive_policy
* [scenario plugin] GnocchiResourceType.list_resource_type
* [scenario plugin] GnocchiResourceType.create_resource_type
* [scenario plugin] GnocchiResourceType.create_delete_resource_type
* [scenario plugin] NeutronSubnets.delete_subnets
* [ci] New Zuul V3 native jobs
* Extend existing@openstack platform to support creating a specification based
  on system environment variables. This feature should be available with
  Rally>0.11.1

Changed
~~~~~~~

* Methods for association and dissociation floating ips  were deprecated in
  novaclient a year ago and latest major release (python-novaclient 10)
  `doesn't include them
  <https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient/blob/10.0.0/releasenotes/notes/remove-virt-interfaces-add-rm-fixed-floating-398c905d9c91cca8.yaml>`_.
  These actions should be performed via neutronclient now. It is not as simple
  as it was via Nova-API and you can find more neutron-related atomic actions
  in results of scenarios.

Removed
~~~~~~~

* *os-hosts* CLIs and python API bindings had been deprecated in
  python-novaclient 9.0.0 and became removed in `10.0.0 release
  <https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient/blob/10.0.0/releasenotes/notes/remove-hosts-d08855550c40b9c6.yaml>`_.
  This decision affected 2 scenarios `NovaHosts.list_hosts
  <https://rally.readthedocs.io/en/0.11.1/plugins/plugin_reference.html#novahosts-list-hosts-scenario>`_
  and `NovaHosts.list_and_get_hosts
  <https://rally.readthedocs.io/en/0.11.1/plugins/plugin_reference.html#novahosts-list-and-get-hosts-scenario>`_
  which become redundant and we cannot leave them (python-novaclient doesn't
  have proper interfaces any more).

Fixed
~~~~~

* The support of `kubernetes python client
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kubernetes>`_ (which is used by Magnum plugins)
  is not limited by 3.0.0 max version. You can use more modern releases of that
  library.
