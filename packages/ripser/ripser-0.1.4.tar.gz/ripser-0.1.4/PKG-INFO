Description: # Ripser
        
        
        Ripser is now a Python class implemented in the Scikit-learn style. It is easy to install, only requires that you have Cython installed first. It is even easier to use.
        
        For the C++ library, see [Ripser/ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser/releases/latest).
        
        
        ## Setup
        
        Installation requires Cython, and currently must be installed from source. An example of how to install is
        ```
        pip install Cython
        pip install Ripser
        ```
        
        We use matplotlib for generating persistence diagrams
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        import numpy as np
        from ripser import Rips
        r = Rips()
        
        data = np.random.random((100,2))
        diagram = r.fit_transform(data)
        r.plot(diagram)
        ```
