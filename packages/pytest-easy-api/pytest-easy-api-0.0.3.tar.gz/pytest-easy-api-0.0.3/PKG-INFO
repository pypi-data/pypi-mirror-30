Description: Pytest Easy Api
        ===============
        
        *A pytest plugin for super simple API testing.*
        
        Using the `api` fixture
        -----------------------
        The `api` fixture, acts as a pass through to a `requests.Session` object, 
        meaning you can make your API calls from it like so:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            def test_my_get_function(api):
                response = api.get('/my-get-endpoint')
                assert response.status_code == 200
        
        
        Anything you can usually do through `requests.Session` you can do through this 
        fixture, but you only need to pass the url extension, meaning you can run these
        same tests on any running instance of your application. 
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        1. Add option to read base url from config.
        2. Tests.
        3. Add documentation.
        4. Add decorator to read mock from json file.
