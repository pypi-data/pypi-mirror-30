Basic notebook smoke tests: Do they run ok? Do they contain lint?

**WARNING: early stage proof of concept; work in progress. Use at your
own risk.**

In particular, this extension is supposed to handle ipython magics as
far as possible, but has not yet been widely tested.

----

This `Pytest`_ plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with `@hackebrot`_'s `Cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template.



Installation
------------

You can install nbsmoke via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install nbsmoke

Or you can install nbsmoke via `conda`_ from `anaconda.org`_::

    $ conda install -c pyviz/label/dev -c conda-forge nbsmoke


Usage
-----

Check all notebooks in examples/ run without errors::

    $ pytest --nbsmoke-run examples/

Check all notebooks in examples/ run without errors, and store html to
look at afterwards::

    $ pytest --nbsmoke-run --store-html=/scratch examples/

Lint check notebooks in examples/::

    $ pytest --nbsmoke-lint notebooks/

Instead of all files in a directory, you can specify a list e.g.::

    $ pytest --nbsmoke-run notebooks/Untitled*.ipynb

Additional options are available by standard pytest 'ini'
configuration in setup.cfg, pytest.ini, or tox.ini::

    [pytest]
    # when running, seconds allowed per cell (see nbconvert timeout)
    cell_timeout = 600

    # notebooks to skip running; one case insensitive re to match per line
    skip_run = ^.*skipme\.ipynb$
               ^.*skipmetoo.*$

    # case insensitive re to match for file to be considered notebook;
    # defaults to ``^.*\.ipynb``
    it_is_nb_file = ^.*\.something$


Contributing
------------

First, install using ``pip install -e .``. Then run the tests using
``tox`` or ``pytest -v tests/``.

New release to PyPI and anaconda.org: ``git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m
"Something about release" && git push --tags``.
