Features
========

StochANNPy provides routines compatible with Scikit-Learn for stochastic
learning including:

* Bayesian neural networks (currently, only classifier) [1]
* Evolutionary neural networks (currently, only classifier)
* Monte-Carlo Cross-Validation (currently, only classifier)

**NOTE**: ENNClassifier, BNNClassifier, MCCVClassifier all passed Scikit-Learn
checks test! ...well almost. Bayesian learning requires more than 5 samples to
explore the weight space, BNNClassifier only pass when increasing the maximum
number of iterations (line 280 of the script). 


Installation
============

The recommended way to install StochANNPy is through pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install stochannpy
    
Otherwise, download and extract the package, then run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install
    

Usage
=====

First, import StochANNPy and initialize the classifier:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from stochannpy import BNNClassifier
    
    clf = BNNClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes = (5,))
    
Fit the training set:

.. code-block:: python

    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
Predict the test set:

.. code-block:: python

    ypred = clf.predict(X_test)
    
Compute the accuracy:

.. code-block:: python

    print(np.mean(ypred == y_test))
