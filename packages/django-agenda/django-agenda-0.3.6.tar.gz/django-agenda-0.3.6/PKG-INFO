Description: =============
        Django Agenda
        =============
        
        
        Django agenda is a django app that allow you to create and book
        times in a schedule. Our goal is to handle all the nasty details for
        you; like timezones, schedule changes, and whether or not a
        specific segment is actually available to be booked.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        First, install via pip (on Windows, replace ``pip3`` with ``pip``)
        
        ::
        
          pip3 install django-agenda
          
        Then, edit your ``settings.py``, adding this line to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
          
        ::
        
              'django_agenda',
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Create recurring availabilities. We should support everything that
          RFC 2445 does.
        * Automatically generate time slots from availabilities. This handles
          overlapping availabilities, timezones, and joining adjacent slots.
        * Subclass AbstractBooking to create bookings. Bookings will reserve
          time slots, and flag them as busy.
        * Uses generic foreign keys, so you can relate your availabilities &
          bookings to anything (a user, an office space, a classroom)
