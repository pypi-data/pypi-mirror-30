Description: ABOUT
        -----
        
        This service/library publishes CNAME records pointing to the local host over multicast DNS using the **Avahi** daemon found in all major Linux distributions. Useful as a poor-man's service discovery or as a helper for named virtual-hosts in development environments.
        
        Since Avahi is compatible with Apple's Bonjour, these names are usable from MacOS X and Windows too.

        DEPENDENCIES
        ------------
        
        Besides a running Avahi daemon, this service requires the ``dbus-python`` bindings which, in turn, requires the development packages for D-Bus and D-Bus Glib (eg. ``dbus-devel`` and ``dbus-glib-devel`` in CentOS 7).
        
        INSTALLATION
        ------------
        
        This package can be installed from source by running::
        
            python setup.py build
            python setup.py install
        
        Or, you can install the latest stable release from PyPI::
        
            pip install mdns-publisher
        
        RUNNING
        -------
        
        Pass (one or more) CNAMEs as command-line arguments to ``mdns-publish-cname``::
        
            mdns-publish-cname name01.local name02.local
        
        Names must use the ``.local`` domain but can have arbitrary sub-domains::
        
            mdns-publish-cname name01.local name02.local name03.mysubdomain.local
        
        If the server running ``mdns-publish-cname`` is being announced over mDNS as ``myserver.local``, all of these names will be answered by Avahi as CNAMEs for ``myserver.local``, regardless of any sub-domains they might have. They remain available as long as ``mdns-publish-cname`` is running.
        
        Run ``mdns-publish-cname`` with no arguments to find out about the available options.
        
        INTEGRATING
        -----------
        
        The ``AvahiPublisher`` class in the ``mpublisher`` module can be integrated into your application to have it publish its own CNAMEs.
