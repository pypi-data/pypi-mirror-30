Description: # Flatlands Driving Simulator for OpenAI Gym
        
        ## Ascent Robotics
        
        Flatlands is a simple gym compatible simulator for a car driving around a track. It is tested with Python3, and Windows/ Ubuntu.
        
        - To use it, clone this repo to your computer with:
        ```shell-script
        git clone git@github.com:ascentai/flatlands-gym.git && cd flatlands-gym
        ```
        
        - Then install the dependencies with:
        ```shell-script
        pip install -e .
        ```
        > Flatlands uses `pygame` for visualization, so if this doesn't work, you may need to install the SDL library on your system as well.
        
        - To create a gym environment you need to import `gym` and then import `flatlands` inside python
        ```python
        import gym
        import flatlands
        
        env = gym.make("Flatlands-v0")
        ```
        
        For a more in depth example, see [demo_flatlands.py](demo_flatlands.py) which drives that car based on the steering angle compared to upcoming points.
