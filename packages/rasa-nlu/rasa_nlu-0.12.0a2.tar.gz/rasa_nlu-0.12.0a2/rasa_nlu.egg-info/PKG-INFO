        Rasa NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is a tool for understanding
        what is being said in short pieces of text. For example, taking a short
        message like:
        
            *"I'm looking for a Mexican restaurant in the center of town"*
        
        And returning structured data like:
        
        ::
        
              intent: search_restaurant
              entities: 
                - cuisine : Mexican
                - location : center
        
        Rasa NLU is primarily used to build chatbots and voice apps, where this
        is called intent classification and entity extraction. To use Rasa, *you
        have to provide some training data*. That is, a set of messages which
        you've already labelled with their intents and entities. Rasa then uses
        machine learning to pick up patterns and generalise to unseen sentences.
        
        You can think of Rasa NLU as a set of high level APIs for building your
        own language parser using existing NLP and ML libraries.
        
        If you are new to Rasa NLU and want to create a bot, you should start
        with the `**tutorial** <https://nlu.rasa.com/tutorial.html>`__.

        Quick Install
        =============
        
        Fur the full installation instructions, please head over to the
        documenation: `Installation <https://nlu.rasa.com/installation.html>`__
        
        **Via Docker Image** From docker hub:
        
        ::
        
            docker run -p 5000:5000 rasa/rasa_nlu:latest-full
        
        (for more docker installation options see `Advanced Docker
        Installation <#advanced-docker>`__)
        
        **Via Python Library** From pypi:
        
        ::
        
            pip install rasa_nlu
            python -m rasa_nlu.server &
        
        (for more python installation options see `Advanced Python
        Installation <#advanced-python>`__)
        
        Basic test
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The below command can be executed for either method used above.
        
        ::
        
            curl 'http://localhost:5000/parse?q=hello'
        
        Example use
        ===========
        
        Get the Server Status
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            curl 'http://localhost:5000/status'
        
        Check the Server Version
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            curl 'http://localhost:5000/version'
        
        Training New Models
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        `Examples <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu/tree/master/data/examples/rasa>`__
        and `Documentation <https://nlu.rasa.com/dataformat.html>`__ of the
        training data format are provided. But as a quick start execute the
        below command to train a new model
        
        Json format
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ::
        
            curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu/master/data/examples/rasa/demo-rasa.json' | \
            curl --request POST --header 'content-type: application/json' -d@- --url 'localhost:5000/train?project=test_model&pipeline=keyword'
        
        This will train a simple keyword based models (not usable for anything
        but this demo). For better pipelines consult the documentation.
        
        Markdown format
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ::
        
            wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu/master/data/examples/rasa/demo-rasa.md'
            curl --request POST --data-binary @demo-rasa.md --url 'localhost:5000/train?project=test_model&pipeline=keyword'
        
        The above command does the following: 1. It Fetches some of the example
        data in the repo 2. It ``POSTS`` that data to the ``/train`` endpoint
        and names the model ``project=test_model``
        
        Parsing New Requests
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Make sure the above command has finished before executing the below. You
        can check with the ``/status`` command above.
        
        ::
        
            curl 'http://localhost:5000/parse?q=hello&project=test_model'
        
        FAQ
        ===
        
        Who is it for?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The intended audience is mainly **people developing bots**, starting
        from scratch or looking to find a a drop-in replacement for
        `wit <https://wit.ai>`__, `LUIS <https://luis.ai>`__, or
        `Dialogflow <https://dialogflow.com>`__. The setup process is designed
        to be as simple as possible. Rasa NLU is written in Python, but you can
        use it from any language through a `HTTP
        API <https://nlu.rasa.com/http.html>`__. If your project is written in
        Python you can `simply import the relevant
        classes <https://nlu.rasa.com/python.html>`__. If you're currently using
        wit/LUIS/Dialogflow, you just:
        
        1. Download your app data from wit, LUIS, or Dialogflow and feed it into
           Rasa NLU
        2. Run Rasa NLU on your machine and switch the URL of your wit/LUIS api
           calls to ``localhost:5000/parse``.
        
        Why should I use Rasa NLU?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  You don't have to hand over your data to FB/MSFT/GOOG
        -  You don't have to make a ``https`` call to parse every message.
        -  You can tune models to work well on your particular use case.
        
        These points are laid out in more detail in a `blog
        post <https://medium.com/lastmile-conversations/do-it-yourself-nlp-for-bot-developers-2e2da2817f3d>`__.
        Rasa is a set of tools for building more advanced bots, developed by the
        company `Rasa <https://rasa.com>`__. Rasa NLU is the natural language
        understanding module, and the first component to be open sourced.
        
        What languages does it support?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Short answer: English, German, and Spanish currently. Longer answer: If
        you want to add a new language, the key things you need are a tokenizer
        and a set of word vectors. More information can be found in the
        `language documentation <https://nlu.rasa.com/languages.html>`__.
        
        How to contribute
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        We are very happy to receive and merge your contributions. There is some
        more information about the style of the code and docs in the
        `documentation <https://nlu.rasa.com/contribute.html>`__.
        
        In general the process is rather simple: 1. create an issue describing
        the feature you want to work on (or have a look at issues with the label
        `help
        wanted <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22>`__)
        2. write your code, tests and documentation 3. create a pull request
        describing your changes
        
        You pull request will be reviewed by a maintainer, who might get back to
        you about any necessary changes or questions. You will also be asked to
        sign the `Contributor License
        Agreement <https://cla-assistant.io/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu>`__
        
        Advanced installation
        =====================
        
        Advanced Python
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        From github:
        
        ::
        
            git clone git@github.com:RasaHQ/rasa_nlu.git
            cd rasa_nlu
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            pip install -e .
        
        For local development make sure you install the development
        requirements:
        
        ::
        
            pip install -r alt_requirements/requirements_dev.txt
            pip install -e .
        
        To test the installation use (this will run a very stupid default model.
        you need to `train your own
        model <https://nlu.rasa.com/tutorial.html>`__ to do something useful!):
        
        Advanced Docker
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Before you start, ensure you have the latest version of docker engine on
        your machine. You can check if you have docker installed by typing
        ``docker -v`` in your terminal.
        
        To see all available builds go to the `Rasa docker
        hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/rasa/rasa_nlu/>`__, but to get up and
        going the quickest just run:
        
        ::
        
            docker run -p 5000:5000 rasa/rasa_nlu:latest-full
        
        There are also three volumes, which you may want to map:
        ``/app/projects``, ``/app/logs``, and ``/app/data``. It is also possible
        to override the config file used by the server by mapping a new config
        file to the volume ``/app/config.json``. For complete docker usage
        instructions go to the official `docker hub
        readme <https://hub.docker.com/r/rasa/rasa_nlu/>`__.
        
        To test run the below command after the container has started. For more
        info on using the HTTP API see
        `here <https://nlu.rasa.com/http.html#endpoints>`__
        
        ::
        
            curl 'http://localhost:5000/parse?q=hello'
        
        Docker Cloud
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Warning! setting up Docker Cloud is quite involved - this method isn't
        recommended unless you've already configured Docker Cloud Nodes (or
        swarms)
        
        |Deploy to Docker Cloud|
        
        Install Pretrained Models for Spacy
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In order to use the spaCy backend make sure you have one of their
        pretrained models installed.
        
        ::
        
            python -m spacy download en
        
        Development Internals
        =====================
        
        Steps to release a new version
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Releasing a new version is quite simple, as the packages are build and
        distributed by travis. The following things need to be done to release a
        new version 1. update
        `rasa\_nlu/version.py <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu/blob/master/rasa_nlu/version.py>`__
        to reflect the correct version number 2. edit the
        `CHANGELOG.rst <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst>`__,
        create a new section for the release (eg by moving the items from the
        collected master section) and create a new master logging section 3.
        edit the `migration
        guide <https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_nlu/blob/master/docs/migrations.rst>`__
        to provide assistance for users updating to the new version 4. commit
        all the above changes and tag a new release, e.g. using
        ``git tag -f 0.7.0 -m "Some helpful line describing the release"     git push origin master --tags``
        travis will build this tag and push a package to
        `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rasa_nlu>`__ 5. only if it is a
        **major release**, a new branch should be created pointing to the same
        commit as the tag to allow for future minor patches, e.g.
        ``git checkout -b 0.7.x     git push origin 0.7.x``
        
        Running the Tests
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In order to run the tests make sure that you have the development
        requirements installed.
        
        ::
        
            make test
