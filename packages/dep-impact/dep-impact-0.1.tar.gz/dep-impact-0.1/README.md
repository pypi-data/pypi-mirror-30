# dep-impact

dep-impact is a Python module for uncertainty quantification mainly based on studying the influence of dependencies between random variables of a probabilistic model through a deterministic function.

For the moment, the class `ConservativeEstimate` creates a probabilistic model with an incomplete description of the dependencies between the input variables. The class can therefore estimates, through a Monte-Carlo sampling, a quantity of interest of a model output distribution. It can also give a conservative estimation of the output quantity by determining a dependence structure that minimize the quantity.

An iterative algorithm is also available.

## Installation

The package is still in development and is not yet available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) or [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/).

Unfortunately, the package needs many python library dependencies:

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/),
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/),
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/),
- [openturns](http://www.openturns.org/),
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/),
- [scikit-optimize](https://github.com/scikit-optimize),
- [pyDOE](https://pythonhosted.org/pyDOE/),
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),
- [rpy2](https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/).

Also, the software [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is needed with the package:

- [VineCopula](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VineCopula/index.html).

However, we are still working on diminishing the number of dependencies. Especially the dependencies with R, by replacing the VineCopula R package with [vinecopulib](https://github.com/vinecopulib/vinecopulib). 

### Using Anaconda

The installation is very straightforward using [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/). If you don't have Anaconda, you can find the software [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and follow the instruction given on the website. The library is tested on python 2.7 and 3.5.

Install the classical dependencies:

```
conda install numpy scipy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

Install OpenTURNS, which is in the conda-forge:

```
conda install -c conda-forge openturns
```

Install the other dependencies which are not in Anaconda:

```
pip install pyDOE scikit-optimize
```

If you don't already have R, you can install it using conda: 

```
conda install -c R R
```

You also need rpy2 to communicate between Python and R:

```
conda install rpy2
```

Then you can install VineCopula using R

```
R -e 'install.packages("VineCopula", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org")'
```

You need a recent version of gcc to install the package. If you don't have a recent one, install it with `conda install gcc`.

## Examples

Several notebook examples are available in the directory [examples](https://github.com/NazBen/dep-impact/tree/master/examples).
