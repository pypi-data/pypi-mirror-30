wrench: a CLI tool for Passbolt
===============================

Installation
------------

Before installing wrench, make sure your system has the following software installed:

- `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ (wrench doesn't work on Python 2)
- `pipsi <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi>`_

If you already have pipsi installed, you can skip the next section and jump
straight to `Installing wrench`_.

Installing pipsi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're lucky enough to have a package manager, you should use it. If you're using Debian or Ubuntu::

  sudo apt install pipsi

Otherwise follow the official installation method::

  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi/master/get-pipsi.py | python

Installing wrench
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now install wrench by running the following command::

  pipsi install passbolt-wrench

Then go to your Passbolt instance, export your private key and run ``wrench
import_key /path/to/your/key.asc`` (you'll be prompted to enter some
configuration values the first time you run wrench).

Contributing
------------

To work on wrench locally it is advised that you create a virtual environment.
There are several ways to do it
(`virtualenvwrapper <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper>`_,
`direnv <https://github.com/direnv/direnv>`_, plain virtual env, etc), but here's
one (this will create a `venv` directory in your current directory, make sure
you don't accidentally commit it)::

  python3 -m venv venv
  . venv/bin/activate

Then use the following command to symlink wrench in your virtualenv. That way
when you run ``wrench`` you'll be running the code from your working copy::

  ./setup.py develop

To run the tests, use the following command::

  ./setup.py test
