*This project is under active development. Its content, API and behavior may change at any time. We mean it.*

Overview

History
-------

nwb-utils was initially a sub-directory of the nwb-schema project. Corresponding history was extracted during
the `4th NWB Hackathon <https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/HCK04_2018_Seattle/>`_ into a
dedicated *pip-installable* project to facilitate its use by both core NWB documentation projects and various
NWB extensions.
