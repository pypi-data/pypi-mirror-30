Description: ## SSH metro client
        
        Client application to communicate and connect to SSH tunnels started by an [SSH metro server]().
        
        The functionalities of this application is limited to request for SSH tunnels creation in an SSH metro server and connect to it via SSH.
        
        ### Technology
        
        SSH metro client uses the following libraries for the specified purpose:
        
        * Requests: The famous and incredible HTTP Requests library to communicate to the SSH metro server.
        * Pexpect: To handled operating system level commands to start an SSH connection to the SSH tunnel.
        
        ### Installation
        
        To install SSH metro client, just run the following command on your machine:
        
        ```
        $> pip install ssh-metro-client
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```
        $> pipenv install ssh-metro-client
        ```
        
        ### Running
        
        To start SSH metro client, you need to specify the details of the target host you want to connect through SSH and the details of the SSH metro server. As an example, you can run a command like the below on your terminal:
        
        ```
        $> ssh_metro_client user@targetmachine_host:targetmachine_port sshmetroserver_host:sshmetroserver_port
        ```
        
        The above command prompts for a password to be provided for the `user` on the target machine `targetmachine_host`. The command below, however, specifies the password for the user as part of the command:
        
        ```
        $> ssh_metro_client user/password@targetmachine_host:targetmachine_port sshmetroserver_host:sshmetroserver_port
        ```
        
        For security reasons, the former is recommended.
