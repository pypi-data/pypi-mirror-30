Description: # `pwnedapi` (Have I Been Pwned)
        
        A small utility class to leverage Troy Hunt's [_Have I Been Pwned API v2_](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#SearchingPwnedPasswordsByRange) and the _k-Anonymity_ model. Inspired by Phil Nash's Ruby gem [_pwned_](https://philnash.github.io/pwned/).
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        In its simplest form you'll only need to use two methods. Will probably add more if and when the API grows.
        
        ```python
        >>> from pwnedapi import Password
        >>> password = Password("mysupersecretpassword")
        >>>
        >>> if password.is_pwned():
        ...     print(f"Your password has been pwned {password.pwned_count} times.")
        ...
        Your password has been pwned 2 times.
        >>>
        ```
        
        ## Support
        
        This is my first official Python package so if something is off feel free to send a PR. :fist:
