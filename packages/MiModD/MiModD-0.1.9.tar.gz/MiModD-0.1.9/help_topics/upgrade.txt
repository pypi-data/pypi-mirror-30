We are always trying to improve MiModD and release new package
versions with enhancements and bug-fixes regularly.

In order to keep you informed about available new versions and to
facilitate upgrades, MiModD features a dedicated upgrade tool.

You can run, at any time:

   python3 -m MiModD.upgrade

to check if there is a new version of MiModD available.

If a new version is found, you can run (possibly with a prepended
"sudo"):

   python3 -m MiModD.upgrade install

to upgrade to the latest version.

You may want to run:

    mimodd help upgrade

for more detailed help on the upgrade tool and the command line
options available with it.
