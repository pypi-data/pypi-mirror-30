        Menuplaceholder: placeholder menu items for Mezzanine
        ==============================================================
        
        About
        -----
        
        The **menuplaceholder** application allows users to add placeholders to the menu
        of a `Mezzanine <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/>`_ CMS website. Menu placeholders
        are "dummy" menu items, which can be used for organising submenus. Users can
        view them (and their children); unlike other types of menu items (such as those
        for rich text pages), users cannot click on placeholders to open them.
        Menu placeholders are provided to structure the hierarchy of
        pages on a site, but are not used to provide content.
        
        The **menuplaceholder** app works with the following things:
        
        * Primary menus
        * Mobile menus
        * Dropdown menus
        * Footers
        * Breadcrumbs
        
        
        Installation and usage
        -----------------------------
        
        Like any Python app, one goes::
        
          python setup.py install
        
        Then add ``"menuplaceholder"`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in the settings.py file
        for your Django installation. Afterwards::
        
          python manage.py makemigrations menuplaceholder
          python manage.py migrate
        
        Once this is done, adding a placeholder menu item (or ten) is trivial.
        
        * Go to the Mezzanine dashboard.
        * Under *Content*, click on *Pages* in order to "Select Page to change".
        * Pick the part of the menu hierarchy you wish to add a menu placeholder, and
          click on "Add...". The dropdown menu now have a new item: "Menu placeholder".
          Select it.
        * Choose a *Title* and then click on *Save*.
