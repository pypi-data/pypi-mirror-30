# aqualogic
A python library to interface with Hayward/Goldline AquaLogic/ProLogic pool controllers. Based on Goldline prototol decoding work done by draythomp (http://www.desert-home.com/p/swimming-pool.html). Will eventually add a [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) component that utilizes this library.
