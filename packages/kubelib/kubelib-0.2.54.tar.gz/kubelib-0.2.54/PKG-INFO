Description: kubelib
        =======
        
        Python library to simplify kubernetes scripting.  Minimal test coverage.
        
        `Full Documentation Here <http://public.safarilab.com/kubelib/>`_
        
        TODO: The current plan is to rebuild this around <https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/client-python>.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Import Kubelib and config::
        
        	import kubelib
        	kube = kubelib.KubeConfig(context='dev-seb', namespace='myspace')
        
        List all namespaces::
        
        	for ns in kubelib.Namespace(kube).get_list():
        		print(ns.metadata.name)
        
        List all resource controllers::
        
            for ns in kubelib.ReplicationController(kube).get_list():
                print(ns.metadata.name)
        
        (you get the idea)
        
        Get a specific pod::
        
            pod = kubelib.Pod(kube).get(podname)
            print(pod.toJSON())
        
        
        Upgrading Kubernetes
        --------------------
        
        Upgrade kubernetes based on a directory of yaml files::
        
            import kubelib
            kube = kubelib.KubeConfig(context='dev-seb', namespace='myspace')
            kube.apply_path("./kubernetes", recursive=True)
        
        This will look at every yaml file and act based on the "Kind" field.  Deployments are replaced, replication controllers are deleted and re-created.  Other "Kind" resources are created if a resource with that "Kind" and "Name" is not already present.
        
        Command Line Utilities
        ----------------------
        
        This package provides a few command line utilities, the most helpful (to me) is `see_limits` which displays the resource limits for all pods and namespaces within a context.
        
        
        ------
        
        Initial package setup borrowed from `https://github.com/kennethreitz/samplemod`
        
        A reasonable approach to getting sphinx output into github pages from `https://daler.github.io/sphinxdoc-test/includeme.html`
