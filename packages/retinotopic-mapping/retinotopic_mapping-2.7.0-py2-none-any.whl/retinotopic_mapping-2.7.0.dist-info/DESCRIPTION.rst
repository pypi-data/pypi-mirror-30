For a more thorough introduction and explanation of the module please
see our [documentation](http://retinotopic-mapping.readthedocs.io/).
If the online version of documentation looks incomplete. Please refer
to the locally built html version in `/doc/build/html/` folder under
`doc` branch.

The retinotopic mapping package is a self-contained module
for display visual stimuli in visual physiology experiments and
for data analysis on the results of those experiments. This package is
used to display visual stimulus and to analyze data for the study
Zhuang et al., 2017 (7)

The visual stimuli generation and display is implemented in the modules
`MonitorSetup.py`, `StimulusRoutines.py` and `DisplayStimulus.py`.
These modules allow you to display flashing circle, sparse noise,
locally sparse noise, drifting grading circle, static grading circle
and others with spherical correction. The method for spherical
correction is the same as Marshel et al. 2011 (2). These stimulus
routines are highly customizable and designed to give the user
significant flexibility and control in creative experimental design.

Please check the '\examples\visual_stimulation' folder for
example script `example_stimulation.py` of visual stimulation.

One specific analysis this package can perform is automated
segmentation of the mouse visual cortex, which is implemented in
`RetinotopicMapping.py` module.
The experimental setup and analysis routine was
modified from Garrett et al. 2014 (1), and closely follows
the protocols and procedures documented in Juavinett et al. 2016
(2).

The analysis takes visual altitude and azimuth maps of mouse cortex
as inputs, calculates the visual sign of each pixel and auto-segments
the cortical surface into primary visual cortex and multiple higher
visual cortices. Ideally, the visual altitude and azimuth maps can be
generated by fourier analysis of population cortical responses to
periodic sweeping checker board visual stimuli (3, 4).

The package also provides some useful plotting functions to visualize
the results.

Please check the '\examples\signmap_analysis' folder for a [jupyter
notebook](https://github.com/zhuangjun1981/retinotopic_mapping/blob/master/retinotopic_mapping/examples/signmap_analysis/retinotopic_mapping_example.ipynb)
showing automated visual area segmentation of mouse cortex.

#### Issues:

1. Most image analysis parameters are defined as number of pixels, not microns.
2. Works in windows, but not fully tested on Mac and Linux.
