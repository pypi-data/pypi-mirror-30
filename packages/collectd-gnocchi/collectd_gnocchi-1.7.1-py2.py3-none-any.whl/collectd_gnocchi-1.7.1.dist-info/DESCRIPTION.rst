This is an output plugin for `collectd`_ that send metrics to `Gnocchi`_. It
will create a resource type named _collectd_ (by default) and a new resource
for each of the host monitored.

Each host will have a list of metrics created dynamically using the following
name convention:

  plugin-plugin_instance/type-type_instance-value_number

In order for the metric to be created correctly, be sure that you have matching
`archive policies rules`_.
