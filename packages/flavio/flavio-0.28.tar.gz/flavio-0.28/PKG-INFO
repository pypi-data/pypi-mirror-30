Description: ``flavio`` is a package to compute observables in flavour physics
              both within the Standard Model of particle physics and in the presence of new
              physics encoded in Wilson coefficients of local dimension-6 operators.
              Observables implemented include rare B meson decays and meson-antimeson
              mixing.
