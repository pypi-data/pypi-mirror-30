            frame (`Frame`, optional): The `Frame` to attach the resulting
            `Dataset`. If `None`, the currently active `Frame` is used and the
            zones are appended by default.

        .. note:: **Possible side-effect when connected to Tecplot 360.**

            Changing the solution times in the dataset or modifying the active
            fieldmaps in a frame may trigger a change in the active plot's
            solution time by the Tecplot 360 interface. This is done to keep
            the GUI controls consistent. In batch mode, no such side-effect
            will take place and the user must take care to set the plot's
            solution time with the `plot.solution_time
            <Cartesian3DFieldPlot.solution_time>` or `plot.solution_timestep
            <Cartesian3DFieldPlot.solution_timestep>` properties.

    .. note:: **Absolute and relative paths with PyTecplot**

        Unless file paths are absolute, saving and loading files will be
        relative to the current working directory of the parent process. This
        is different when running the PyTecplot script in batch mode and when
        running in connected mode with `tecplot.session.connect()`. In batch
        mode, paths will be relative to Python's current working directory as
        obtained by :func:`os.getcwd()`. When connected to an instance of Tecplot
        360, paths will be relative to Tecplot 360's' start-up folder which is
        typically the Tecplot 360 installation "bin" folder.
