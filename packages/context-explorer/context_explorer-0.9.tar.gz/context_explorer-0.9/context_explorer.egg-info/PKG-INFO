Description: # ContextExplorer
        
        Thanks for stopping by! `（ ^_^）o自自o（^_^ ）`
        
        ContextExplorer is a software program that facilitates analyses of data
        extracted from microscope images of cells.
        
        ## Relevance
        
        The analyses methods in ContextExplorer focuses on how populations of cells are
        affected by their microenvironment, including local variations in cell
        signalling and cell density. It is currently difficult for scientist without
        previous programming experience to quantify these variables, although it is
        relevant for many research areas. Facilitating this type of analyses can help
        scientist around the world to improve their understanding of cellular behavior
        and accelerate their research.

        Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! This does not have to be
        code-related, don't be shy =) Please read [the contributing
        guidelines](https://gitlab.com/joelostblom/context-explorer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
        to get started.
        
        ## Using ContextExplorer
        
        ### Installation
        
        Currently, the software is distributed as source code only. The required
        dependencies are `python3`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`,
        `shapely`, and `natsort`. A `conda` package will be created shortly to
        facilitate installation.
        
        ### Overview
        
        ContextExplorer is controlled via a graphical user interface and aims to enable
        powerful analysis and visualizations of single cell data extracted from
        microscope images for a broad scientific audience. ContextExplorer can
        work in tandem with many other tools since it only depends on a correctly
        formatted CSV-file as input and only outputs commonly used file formats (`.csv`,
        `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.pdf`)
        
        Detailed documentation and workflow examples are available at the [documentation
        page](http://contextexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
