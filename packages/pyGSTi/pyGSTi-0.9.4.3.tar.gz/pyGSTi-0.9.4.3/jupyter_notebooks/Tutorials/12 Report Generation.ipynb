    "# Report Generation Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi is able to construct polished report documents, which provide high-level summaries as well as detailed analyses  of GST results.  Reports are intended to be quick and easy way of analyzing a GST estimate, and pyGSTi's report generation functions are specifically designed to interact with its high-level driver functions (see the high-level algorithms tutorial).  Currently there is only a single report generation function, `pygsti.report.create_general_report`, which takes one or more `Results` objects as input and produces an HTML file as output.  The HTML format allows the reports to include **interactive plots** and **switches**, making it easy to compare different types of analysis or data sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi's \"general\" report creates a stand-alone HTML document which cannot run Python.  Thus, all the results displayed in the report must be pre-computed (in Python).  If you find yourself wanting to fiddle with things and feel that the general report is too static, please consider using a `Workspace` object (see following tutorials) within a Jupyter notebook, where you can intermix report tables/plots and Python.  Internally, `create_general_report` is just a canned routine which uses a `WorkSpace` object to generate various tables and plots and then inserts them into a HTML template.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note to veteran users:** PyGSTi has recently transitioned to producing HTML (rather than LaTeX/PDF) reports.  The way to generate such report is largely unchanged, with one important exception.  Previously, the `Results` object had various report-generation methods included within it.  We've found this is too restrictive, as we'd sometimes like to generate a report which utilizes the results from multiple runs of GST (to compare the, for instance).  Thus, the `Results` class is now just a container for a `DataSet` and its related `GateSet`s, `GatestringStructure`s, etc.  All of the report-generation capability is now housed in within separate report functions, which we now demonstrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get some `Results`\n",
    "We start by performing GST using `do_long_sequence_gst`, as usual, to create a `Results` object (we could also have just loaded one from file)."

    "There are several remarks about these reports worth noting:\n",
    "1. The **HTML reports are the primary report type in pyGSTi**, and are much more flexible.  The PDF reports are more limited (they can only display a *single* estimate and gauge optimization), and essentially contain a subset of the information and descriptive text of a HTML report.  So, if you can, use the HTML reports.  The PDF report's strength is its portability: PDFs are easily displayed by many devices, and they embed all that they need neatly into a single file.  **If you need to generate a PDF report** from `Results` objects that have multiple estimates and/or gauge optimizations, consider using the `Results` object's `view` method to single out the estimate and gauge optimization you're after.\n",
    "2. It's best to use **Firefox** when opening the HTML reports. (If there's a problem with your brower's capabilities it will be shown on the screen when you try to load the report.)\n",
    "3. You'll need **`pdflatex`** on your system to compile PDF reports.\n",

In each case we'll call `do_long_sequence_gst` with `gaugeOptParams=False`, so that no gauge optimization is done, and then perform several gauge optimizations separately and add these to the `Results` object via its `add_gaugeoptimized` function."

As an intended side effect, each of these figures is cached, along with some of the intermediate results used to create it.

    "- Setting the `link_to` argument to a tuple of `'pkl'`, `'tex'`, and/or `'pdf'` will create hyperlinks within the plots or below the tables of the HTML linking to Python pickle, LaTeX source, and PDF versions of the content, respectively.  The Python pickle files for tables contain pickled pandas `DataFrame` objects, wheras those of plots contain ordinary Python dictionaries of the data that is plotted.  Applies to HTML reports only.\n",

Using `brevity > 0` will reduce the time required to create, and later load, the report, as well as the output file/folder size.  This applies to both HTML and PDF reports.\n",

    "## Advanced Reports: `create_report_notebook`\n",
    "In addition to the standard HTML-page reports demonstrated above, pyGSTi is able to generate a Jupyter notebook containing the Python commands to create the figures and tables within a general report.  This is facilitated\n",
    "by `Workspace` objects, which are factories for figures and tables (see previous tutorials).  By calling `create_report_notebook`, all of the relevant `Workspace` initialization and calls are dumped to a new notebook file, which can be run (either fully or partially) by the user at their convenience.  Creating such \"report notebooks\" has the advantage that the user may insert Python code amidst the figure and table generation calls to inspect or modify what is display in a highly customizable fashion.  The chief disadvantages of report notebooks is that they require the user to 1) have a Jupyter server up and running and 2) to run the notebook before any figures are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line below demonstrates how to create a report notebook using `create_report_notebook`.  Note that the argument list is very similar to `create_general_report`."
