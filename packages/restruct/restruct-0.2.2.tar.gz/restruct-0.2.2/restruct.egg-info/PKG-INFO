Description: Restruct is an easy light-weight formatting library that simplifies the process of representing
        SQL results in a human readable format (JSON).  Pass the restruct method your SQL results and a
        formatting structure and voila, you have turned your complex SQL result into beautiful JSON.  One of
        the best features of Restruct is squashing all the duplicate entries from SQL joins into a sub
        section of your JSON structure.
        
        ===============
         Usage examples
        ===============
        
        *Lets assume we have a database with a user table that can be fetched with this query:*
        
        ::
        
              SELECT id,
                     first_name,
                     last_name,
                     email,
                     age
                FROM users
        
        Formatting
        =============
        
        *Here is how you could write a simple template to turn the SQL result (list of dicts) into a
         prettier JSON structure:*
        
        ::
        
              struct = {
                  "< id": {
                      "id": "< id",
                      "name": {
                          "first": "< first_name",
                          "last": "< last_name",
                          "full": "{{first_name}} {{last_name}}"
                      },
                      "email": "< email",
                      "age": "< age"
                  }
              }
          
              collection		= Restruct.collection( <list_of_dicts_from_database_query> )
              collection.format(struct)
          
              # Example output:
              {
                  273667: {
                      "id": 273667,
                      "name": {
                          "first": "Jeff",
                          "last": "Goldbloom",
                          "full": "Jeff Goldbloom"
                      },
                      "email": "jeff.goldbloom@example.com",
                      "age": 49
                  },
                  93892: {
                      "id": 93892,
                      "name": {
                          "first": "Marty",
                          "last": "Mcfly",
                          "full": "Marty Mcfly"
                      },
                      "email": "marty.mcfly@example.com",
                      "age": 17
                  },
                  ...
