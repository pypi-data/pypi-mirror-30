        About
        =====
        
        **Pyrogram** is a fully functional Telegram Client Library written from the ground up in Python.
        It offers simple and complete access to the `Telegram Messenger API`_ and is designed for Python
        developers keen on building custom Telegram applications.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -   **Easy to setup**: Pyrogram can be easily installed and upgraded using **pip**, requires
            a minimal set of dependencies (which are also automatically managed) and very few lines
            of code to get started with.
        
        -   **Easy to use**: Pyrogram provides idiomatic, developer-friendly, clean and readable
            Python code (either generated or hand-written) making the Telegram API simple to use.
        
        -   **High level**: Pyrogram automatically handles all the low-level details of
            communication with the Telegram servers by implementing the
            `MTProto Mobile Protocol v2.0`_ and the mechanisms needed for establishing
            a reliable connection.
        
        -   **Fast**: Pyrogram's speed is boosted up by `TgCrypto`_, a high-performance, easy-to-install
            Telegram Crypto Library written in C as a Python extension.
        
        -   **Updated**: Pyrogram makes use of the latest Telegram API version, currently `Layer 75`_.
        
        -   **Documented**: Pyrogram API public methods are documented and resemble the well
            established Telegram Bot API, thus offering a familiar look to Bot developers.
        
        -   **Full API support**: Beside the simple, bot-like methods offered by the Pyrogram API,
            the library also provides a complete, low-level access to every single Telegram API method.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -   Python 3.3 or higher.
        
        -   A Telegram API key.
            
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        -   You can easily install and upgrade the library using standard Python tools:
        
            .. code:: shell
        
                $ pip3 install --upgrade pyrogram
                
        -   Or, with TgCrypto_:
        
            .. code:: shell
        
                $ pip3 install --upgrade pyrogram[tgcrypto]
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        -   Create a new ``config.ini`` file at the root of your working directory, copy-paste
            the following and replace the **api_id** and **api_hash** values with `your own`_:
        
            .. code:: ini
        
                [pyrogram]
                api_id = 12345
                api_hash = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        -   And here's how Pyrogram looks like:
        
            .. code:: python
        
                from pyrogram import Client
        
                client = Client("example")
                client.start()
        
                client.send_message("me", "Hi there! I'm using Pyrogram")
                client.send_photo("me", "/home/dan/pic.jpg", "Nice photo!")
        
                client.stop()
            
        That's all you need for getting started with Pyrogram. For more detailed information,
        please refer to the Documentation_.
