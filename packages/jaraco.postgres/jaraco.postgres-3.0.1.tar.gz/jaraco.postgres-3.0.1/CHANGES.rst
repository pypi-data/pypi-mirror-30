3.0.1
=====

#2: When searching heuristic paths, sort parsed version numbers
numerically so that 10 is greater than 9.

3.0
===

Removed global variables and behavior on import:

- root
- INITDB
- PG_CTL
- PSQL
- POSTGRES

Instead, use ``PostgresFinder.find_root()``.

2.0.1
=====

#1: Fix version detection on Postgres 10.0.

2.0
===

PostgresServer now creates all databases with a default
locale of ``en_US.UTF-8``. Now, databases will be
Unicode-capable by default. To restore the original
behavior, deferring to the system locale, pass
``locale=None`` to ``initdb``.

1.6
===

Add ``.create`` convenience method to PostgresServer.

1.5
===

Project is now released automatically through Travis
Continuous Integration.

Add Trove classifier for Pytest Framework.

Moved hosting to Github and updated skeleton.

1.2

Added some logging info to initdb, start, stop.

Substantial improvements for test suite.

Allow the POSTGRESQL_HOME environment variable to stipulate where
the Postgres binaries must be found, overriding heuristic search.
