Description: ====================

        ====================
        
        Adapter between opentracing-python and py_zipkin.
        
        
        Motivation
        ==========
        
        Currently there are no great options for a Python 3 compatible opentracing
        client. py_zipkin (https://github.com/Yelp/py_zipkin) is a Python 3 supporting
        zipkin client which closely resembles the OpenTracing API. With minimal effort
        we can create an adapter between opentracing-python
        (https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-python) and py_zipkin.
