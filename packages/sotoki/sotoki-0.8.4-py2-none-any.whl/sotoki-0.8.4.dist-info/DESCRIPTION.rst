# Sotoki

*Stack Overflow to Kiwix*

The goal of this project is to create a suite of tools to create
[zim](http://www.openzim.org) files required by
[kiwix](http://kiwix.org/) reader to make available [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
offline (without access to Internet).

## Getting started

Download the last [stackexchange dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange)
using BitTorrent (only "superuser.com.7z" is necessary) and put it in the Sotoki
source code root.
The use of btrfs as a file system is recommended (and required for stackoverflow)
