Description: 
        Effectful Pythonic Parsers
        ==========================
        
        Welcome to the home of EPP library, which provides a way to combine basic
        parsers and effects to build complex parsers that transform text into something
        more useful.
        
        For a quick introduction into using the library, see ``quickstart.rst`` in the
        ``docs`` directory. If you find that a certain parser should be written
        directly, and not as a combination of existing ones, see ``writing_parsers.rst``
        in the same directory (and if it's something that makes sense to be included in
        the library proper, file a pull request!). Finally, ``core.rst`` and
        ``parsers.rst`` provide full documentation of existing parsers in the ``core``
        and ``parsers`` module respectively (you shouldn't care much which parser
        belongs where, it's just to keep bookkeeping parsers separated from those doing
        actual parsing).
