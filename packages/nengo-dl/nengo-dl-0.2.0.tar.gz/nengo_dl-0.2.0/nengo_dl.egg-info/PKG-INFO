Description: NengoDL: Deep learning integration for Nengo
        ============================================
        
        NengoDL is a simulator for `Nengo <https://pythonhosted.org/nengo/>`_ models.
        That means it takes a Nengo network as input, and allows the user to simulate
        that network using some underlying computational framework (in this case,
        TensorFlow).
        
        In practice, what that means is that your code for constructing a Nengo model
        is exactly the same as it would be for the standard Nengo simulator.  All that
        changes is that we use a different Simulator class to execute the
        model.
        
        For example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import nengo
            import nengo_dl
            import numpy as np
        
            with nengo.Network() as net:
                inp = nengo.Node(output=np.sin)
                ens = nengo.Ensemble(50, 1, neuron_type=nengo.LIF())
                nengo.Connection(inp, ens, synapse=0.1)
                p = nengo.Probe(ens)
        
            with nengo_dl.Simulator(net) as sim: # this is the only line that changes
                sim.run(1.0)
        
            print(sim.data[p])
        
        However, NengoDL is not simply a duplicate of the Nengo simulator.  It also
        adds a number of unique features, such as:
        
        - optimizing the parameters of a model through deep learning
          training methods
        - faster simulation speed, on both CPU and GPU
        - inserting networks defined using TensorFlow (such as
          convolutional neural networks) directly into a Nengo model
        
        More details can be found in the `NengoDL documentation
        <https://nengo.github.io/nengo_dl/>`_.
