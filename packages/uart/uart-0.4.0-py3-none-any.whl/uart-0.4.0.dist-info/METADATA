b"# uart register tool\n\n. uart does not refer to the hardware device!\n\n## Concept\n\nThe main goal of the project is to able to automatically create and modify VHLD bus slave modules based on a simple definition format. By employing VHDL records the handling of the registers can be completely hidden in a module seperate from the rest of the designers logic. All referring to the registers are done via a record which specifies if the register is read-only or read-write, and also includes the name. All bus-specific signals are also wrapped in records. This increases the readability of the design as a whole.\n\n## Bus support\n\nuart currently supports these bus-types:\n\n- AXI4-lite\n  \n\n## Getting Started\n\n`pip install uart`\n\n\n### Usage\n\n`uart.py FILE [-o DIR]`\n\n`uart.py -c FILE [-o DIR]`\n\n`uart.py -e FILE [-o DIR]`\n\n`uart.py --version`\n\n`uart.py -h | --help`\n  \n\n### Examples\n\nThe examples folder contain a JSON-file generated by the menu-system. This file is readable to the point that you can create your own from this template alone if you can't bothered with the menu-system. The folder also contain the output files generated based on the JSON-file.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you have ideas on how to improve the project, please review [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
