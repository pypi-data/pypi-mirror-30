Description: Jitbit Helpdesk widget plugin
        -----------------------------
        
        This is a tiny plugin that allows integrating Jitbit Helpdesk into an existing python web-application or a website. It places the JS-code onto your webpages that displays an interactive support widget to your visitors.
        
        Your website visitors/users will be able to submit support tickets right from within your web-application or a website.
        
        You still require an either on-premises or hosted installation of the Jitbit app (available free on the website, the trial version does not expire so you can use it as long as you need).
