Description: ### What is this repository for? ###
        
        * python based SDK  
        * v0.1
        
        This repo implements the SDK to manage projects and models on a local fitchain pod
        
        ### Feedback ###
        Reach out and tell us how we can improve this SDK to make it easier for you to work with the pod and build your models. 
        
        You may always drop us a mail at ```code@fitchain.io``` 
        
        
        ### Getting Started ###
        First install the fitchain sdk using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install fitchain
        ```
        
        Once the fitchain sdk has been installed, you can use the library:
        
        ```python
        from fitchain import FitChain
        
        fc = FitChain()
        ```
        
        Call the ```projects()``` method to get an overview of all available projects. You may even enter a query string to 
        filter your results.
        
        ```python
        projects = fc.projects()
        ```
        
        Once a project has been chosen, the datasources linked to the project can be retrieved using the ```datasources``` property
        ```python
        project = projects[...]
        project_datasources = project.datasources
        ```
        
        Data for a specific datasource can be loaded by calling the ```load(<datasource_id)``` method on the project
        ```python
        project_datasource_id = ...
        project.load(project_datasource_id)
        ```
        
        ### Reference
