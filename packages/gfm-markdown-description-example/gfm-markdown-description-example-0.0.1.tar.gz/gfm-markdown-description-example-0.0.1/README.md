# Github-Flavored Markdown Example Project

No docutils, pandoc, or any other tricks! Just a `README.md` and a `setup.py`.

This is forked from [@di/markdown-description-example](https://github.com/di/markdown-description-example)/

See the source for this project here: https://github.com/jonparrott/gfm-markdown-description-example.

Instructions to do this for your project are here: TODO

## What we can do:

We can do normal markdown stuff like *italics* and **bold text**.

* Lists
* Are
* Fun
* Too
  * (But please use responsibly)

Code blocks:

```
>>> pypi_supports_markdown
True
```

But *now* you can also do GitHub fun stuff like tables:

| foo | bar |
| --- | --- |
| baz | bim |

And ~~Strikethrough~~. And autolinks such as https://blog.jonparrott.com. :)
