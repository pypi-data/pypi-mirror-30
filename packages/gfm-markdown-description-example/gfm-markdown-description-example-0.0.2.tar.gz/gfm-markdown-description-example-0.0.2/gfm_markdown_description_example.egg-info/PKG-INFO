Description: # Github-Flavored Markdown Example Project
        
        No docutils, pandoc, or any other tricks! Just a `README.md` and a `setup.py`.
        
        This is forked from [@di/markdown-description-example](https://github.com/di/markdown-description-example).
        
        See the source for this project here: https://github.com/jonparrott/gfm-markdown-description-example.
        
        Instructions to do this for your project are here: https://dustingram.com/articles/2018/03/16/markdown-descriptions-on-pypi
        
        ## What we can do:
        
        We can do normal markdown stuff like *italics* and **bold text**.
        
        * Lists
        * Are
        * Fun
        * Too
          * (But please use responsibly)
        
        Code blocks:
        
        ```
        >>> pypi_supports_markdown
        True
        ```
        
        But *now* you can also do GitHub fun stuff like tables:
        
        | foo | bar |
        | --- | --- |
        | baz | bim |
        
        And ~~Strikethrough~~. And autolinks such as https://blog.jonparrott.com. :)
