Tale is a framework for creating interactive fiction (text adventures), or MUDs (multi-user dungeons).

It's still being developed and new features are implement along the way,
but the current version is quite capable of running an interactive fiction story world.
Also the basics for a multi-user (MUD) server are working nicely.

An example test/demo story is included in the ``stories`` directory of the distribution archive.
This will require you to extract the source archive manually.

You can also run the tiny embedded test story like this, after you've installed the framework::

    $ python -m tale.demo.story

The source code repository is on Github: https://github.com/irmen/Tale
