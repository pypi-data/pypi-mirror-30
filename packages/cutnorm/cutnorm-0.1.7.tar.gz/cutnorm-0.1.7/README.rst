Approximation via Gaussian Rounding and Optimization with Orthogonality Constraints
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package computes the approximations to the cutnorm using some of the techniques detailed by Alon and Noar [ALON2004]_ and a fast optimization algorithm by Wen and Yin [WEN2013]_.

Example Usage
-------------

Below is an example of using the cutnorm package and tools. Given two graphs A and B, we wish to compute a norm for the difference matrix (A - B) between the two graphs. An obvious example to represent the advantage of using a cutnorm over l1 norm is to consider A and B as `Erdos-Renyi random graphs`_. Under a fixed vertex set, an Erdos-Renyi random graph is one where a fixed probability determines the presence of an edge.

.. _`Erdos-Renyi random graphs`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model

Given two Erdos-Renyi random graphs with fix n and p=0.5, the edit distance (l1 norm) of the difference (after normalization) is 1/2 with large probability. However, these two graphs have the same global structure. The edit distance fails as a notion of 'distance' between the two graphs in the perspective of global structural similarity as discussed by Lovasz [LOVASZ2009]_. The cutnorm is a measure of distance that reflects global structural similarity. In fact, the cutnorm of the difference for this example approaches 0 as n grows.

.. code:: python

  import numpy as np
  from cutnorm import compute_cutnorm, tools

  # Generate Erdos Renyi Random Graph
  n = 100
  p = 0.5
  erdos_renyi_a = tools.sbm.erdos_renyi(n, p)
  erdos_renyi_b = tools.sbm.erdos_renyi(n, p)

  # Compute l1 norm
  normalized_diff = (erdos_renyi_a - erdos_renyi_b) / n**2
  l1 = np.linalg.norm(normalized_diff.flatten(), ord=1)

  # Compute cutnorm
  cutn_round, cutn_sdp, info = compute_cutnorm(erdos_renyi_a, erdos_renyi_b)

  print("l1 norm: ", l1)  # prints l1 norm value near ~0.5
  print("cutnorm rounded: ",
        cutn_round)  # prints cutnorm rounded solution near ~0
  print("cutnorm sdp: ", cutn_sdp)  # prints cutnorm sdp solution near ~0
