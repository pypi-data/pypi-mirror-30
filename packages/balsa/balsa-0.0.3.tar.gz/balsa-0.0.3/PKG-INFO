        =======================
        
        Simple to use package that sets up Python logging.  With just a few lines of code get well formatted file and
        console or GUI logging.

            log = get_logger(application_name)
        
        
            def main():
                balsa = Balsa(application_name, 'james abel')
                balsa.init_logger()
                log.error('my error example')
        
        
        Where did the name come from?
