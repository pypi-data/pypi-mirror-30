        =====
        
        Creates and populates configs for an app at first-time setup.
        
        Are you sick and tired of writing packages or apps that are super great
        but don’t work unless your end-user scours your README for instructions
        on how to structure config files and how and where to instantiate them?
        
        figgy allows you to ship code and have the end-user developer install
        and configure it just by running your app or package. You can call it
        from setup.py or bind it to whatever you like in your code so the
        results of the new configuration are made immediately available to
        whatever context the app or package will be used in.
        
        --------------
        
        Warning
        -------
        
        This software is in alpha development. That said, this package should
        work. Please report bugs.
        
        Key caveats: 
        - Outputs your configuration data to the screen in some
        cases.
        - Only supports json.
        - Only available for python 3. 
        - You want this module to prompt from TTY. 
        - You’re on a ’NIX system.
        
        These are intended to guide feature development for future versions, but
        in this state it should be useful nonetheless.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install figgy
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First import figgy
        
        ::
        
            import figgy
        
        Then define your config template
        
        ::
        
            template = {
                'username': 'default',
                'password': 'anotherdefault'
            }
        
        All you need to do is call ``make()``.
        
        ::
        
            figgy.make(template)
        
        and the end user will be prompted with:
        
        ::
        
            Enter value for "username"
            (return for default "default")': ▋userinput
            Enter value for "username"
            (return for default "default")': 
            Set "username" to "userinput" in ./config.json
            Enter value for "password"
            (return for default "anotherdefault")': ▋anotheruserinput
            Enter value for "password"
            (return for default "anotherdefault")': 
            Set "password" to "anotheruserinput" in ./config.json
        
        and generate a ``config.json`` file:
        
        ::
        
            {"username": "userinput", "password": "anotheruserinput"}
        
        If you want the data to be used in the application after it’s created
        use
        
        ::
        
            config = figgy.make(template)
        
        so that you can access the data like so
        
        ::
        
            username = config['username']
            password = config['password']
        
        By default figgy assumes a few things:
        
        -  You want the file to be named ``config.json``
        -  You want the file generated at the path the python code that executes
           it runs from
        -  You want the function to return the configuration data
        -  The user interface is TTY
        
        But you can change most of that:
        
        source code:
        
        ::
        
            template = {
                'PORT': '3000',
                'DEBUG': 'True'
            }
            figgy.make(data=template, filename='appconfig')
        
        prompts:
        
        ::
        
            Enter value for "PORT"
            (return for default "3000")': ▋8080
            Set "PORT" to "8080" in ./appconfig.json
            Enter value for "DEBUG"
            (return for default "True")': ▋False
        
        and returns:
        
        ::
        
            Set "DEBUG" to "False" in ./appconfig.json
            {'./appconfig.json': {'PORT': '3000', 'DEBUG': 'True'}}
        
        source code:
        
        ::
        
            figgy.make(data=template, get=False)
        
        generates the prompts:
        
        ::
        
            Enter value for "username"
            (return for default "default")': ▋userinput
            Set "username" to "userinput" in ./config.json
            Enter value for "password"
            (return for default "anotherdefault")': ▋anotheruserinput
            Set "password" to "anotheruserinput" in ./config.json
        
        and returns:
        
        ::
        
            None
