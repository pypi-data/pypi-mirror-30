Amadeus provides a set of APIs for the travel industry. Flights, Hotels,
Locations and more.

For more details see the `Python
documentation <https://developers.amadeus.com/docs/python>`__ on
`Amadeus.com <https://developers.amadeus.com>`__ and the `class
reference <https://amadeus4dev.github.io/amadeus-python>`__ here on
GitHub.

Installation
------------

This SDK requires Python 2.7+ or 3.3+. You can install install it
directly with pip.

.. code:: sh

    pip install amadeus==1.0.0b6

**Next**: `Get Started with the Python
SDK. <https://developers.amadeus.com/docs/python/get_started/initialize>`__

Getting Started
---------------

To make your first API call you will need to `register for an
Amadeus Developer Account <https://developers.amadeus.com/register>`__
and `set up your first
application <https://dashboard.developers.amadeus.com/applications>`__.

.. code:: py

    from amadeus import Client, ResponseError

    amadeus = Client(
        client_id='[YOUR_CLIENT_ID]',
        client_secret='[YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET]'
    )

    try:
        response = amadeus.reference_data.urls.checkin_links.get(airline='1X')
        print(response.data)
        # => [{'type': 'checkin-link', 'id': '1XEN-GBWeb', 'href': 'https://www....
    except ResponseError as error:
        print(error)

**Next**: `Learn more about checkin
links <https://developers.amadeus.com/docs/python/get_started/checkin_links>`__
with our Python SDK.

Initialization
--------------

The client can be initialized directly.

.. code:: py

    # Initialize using parameters
    amadeus = Client(client_id='...', client_secret='...')

Alternatively it can be initialized without any paramters if the
environment variables ``AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID`` and
``AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET`` are present.

.. code:: py

    amadeus = Client()

Your credentials can be found on the `Amadeus
dashboard <https://dashboard.developers.amadeus.com/client_ids>`__. `Sign
up <https://developers.amadeus.com/register>`__ for an account today.

By default the environment for the SDK is the ``test`` environment. To
switch to a production (paid-for) environment please switch the hostname
as follows:

.. code:: py

    amadeus = Client(hostname='production')

**Next**: `Learn more about our initializing the Python
SDK <https://developers.amadeus.com/docs/python/get_started_initialize>`__
in our documentation.

documentation for in-depth information about every SDK method, itâ€™s
arguments and return types.

Additionally, this SDK has extensive documentation of itself available
on `GitHub <https://amadeus4dev.github.io/amadeus-python/>`__.

Making API calls
----------------

This library conveniently maps every API path to a similar path.

For example, ``GET /v2/reference-data/urls/checkin-links?airline=1X``
would be:

.. code:: py

    amadeus.reference_data.urls.checkin_links.get(airline='1X')

Similarly, to select a resource by ID, you can pass in the ID to the
singular path.

For example, ``GET /v1/shopping/hotels/123/hotel-offers`` would be:

.. code:: py

    amadeus.hotel(123).hotel_offers.get(...)

You can make any arbitrary API call as well directly with the ``.get``
method:

.. code:: py

    amadeus.get('/v2/reference-data/urls/checkin-links', airline='1X')

Response
--------

Every API call returns a ``Response`` object. If the API call contained
a JSON response it will parse the JSON into the ``.result`` attribute.
If this data also contains a ``data`` key, it will make that available
as the ``.data`` attribute. The raw body of the response is always
avaulable as the ``.body`` attribute.

.. code:: py

    from amadeus import Location

    response = amadeus.reference_data.locations.get(
        keyword='LON',
        subType=Location.ANY
    )

    print(reponse.body) #=> The raw response, as a string
    print(reponse.result) #=> The body parsed as JSON, if the result was parsable
    print(response.data) #=> The list of locations, extracted from the JSON

Pagination
----------

If an API endpoint supports pagination, the other pages are available
under the ``.next``, ``.previous``, ``.last`` and ``.first`` methods.

.. code:: py

    from amadeus import Location

    response = amadeus.reference_data.locations.get(
        keyword='LON',
        subType=Location.ANY
    )

    amadeus.next(response) #=> returns a new response for the next page

If a page is not available, the method will return ``None``.

Logging & Debugging
-------------------

The SDK makes it easy to add your own logger.

.. code:: py

    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger('your_logger')
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    amadeus = Client(
        client_id='...',
        client_secret='...',
        logger=logger
    )

Additionally, to enable more verbose logging, you can set the
appropriate level on your own logger, though the easiest way would be to
enable debugging via a parameter on initialization, or using the
``AMADEUS_LOG_LEVEL`` environment variable.

.. code:: py

    amadeus = Client(
        client_id='...',
        client_secret='...',
        log_level='debug'
    )
