        How to use
        ==========
        
        The default implementation is based on the Plone *resolveuid* feature.
        This will not work (and shows anything) for contents without the *plone.uuid* support. You can however
        customize and develop additional adapters for providing permalink for yours types (or customize
        the default one).
        
        The new resource will be added to the *document actions* section.
