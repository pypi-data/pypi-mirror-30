Description: 
        The goal of this package is to be a replacement for GNU autoconf support
        for a package which needs to "inspect" the local host system to see if
        it needs some special local configurations to make it work.
        
        The idea is to replace the 'configure' script generated by an assortment
        of autoconf tools (... along with all of the dependencies of ``sed``,
        ``gawk``, ``make``, ... which generally must be the GNU versions) with a
        pure Python implementation. Ideally, it is basically an extension of the
        functionality in distutils, and relies heavily on that infrastructure.
        
        Have a look at the README.md in the source repo.
