=============
Command Specs
=============

Specifications for new commands, objects and actions are listed below.
These specifications have not been implemented. See
:doc:`Command List <../command-list>` for implemented commands and
:doc:`Command Structure <../commands>` for implemented objects and actions.

It is optional to propose a specifications patch for new commands,
objects and actions here before submitting the implementation. Once your
specifications patch merges then you may proceed with the implementation.
Your implementation patches should move applicable portions of the
specifications patch to the official :doc:`Command List <../command-list>`
and :doc:`Command Structure <../commands>` documentation.
