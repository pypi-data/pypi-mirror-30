# PYNT (PYthon iNTeractive)

Emacs minor mode for generating and interacting with jupyter notebooks.

## Quick Start

First install the codebook module [from PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/codebook) with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```
pip install codebook
```

pynt is [available](https://melpa.org/#/pynt) for download through [MELPA](https://melpa.org/). Once you have [configured](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started) emacs to use MELPA then run the following commands in emacs.

```
M-x package-install RET pynt
C-x C-f my-python-file.py
M-x pynt-mode
```

## Feature List

- *Jupyter notebook server management*
  - A jupyter notebook server will be started in your home directory when you start emacs so you don't have to.

- *On-the-fly notebook creation*
  - Every code region gets its own jupyter notebook and these jupyter notebooks are generated automatically.
- *Attach a jupyter notebook to a running process*
  - Launch a process from the command line which hits the code region. Restart the kernel in the notebook to attach to that process.
- *Dump code into jupyter notebooks*
  - No more copy and pasting from code into jupyter notebooks. Each expression gets its own cell. Assignment expressions are further transformed so that when you evaluate its cell the value of the target is displayed.
- *Loop rewriting*
  - Unroll the first pass of loops for easy interaction in a notebook.
- *Scroll the resulting jupyter notebook with the code buffer*
  - Scrolling the code buffer scrolls the notebook along with it, even when cells are modified.
- *Multiple notebooks in one window*
  - Put code and tests on top of each other and have their corresponding notebooks alongside.

## Using pynt

Once you have opened a python file and pynt mode is active you should select the region of code you would like to dump into a jupyter notebook by typing `C-c C-s` and cycling though the resulting code regions. Once you have made a selection hit `C-c C-e` to dump that code region into a jupyter notebook.

It is recommended at this point to enable `pynt-scroll-mode` which scrolls (i.e. aligns) the notebook cells with the code lines. You can activate `pynt-scroll-mode` with `M-x pynt-scroll-mode RET`.

## EIN Tweaks

There are a few tweaks to EIN that make the pynt/EIN experience nicer IMO.

- Have `C-<return>` and `S-<return>` behave [as they would in a jupyter web browser client](https://github.com/ebanner/dotfiles/blob/deed94b024612ca1ed9c1e98f8e98ade793208a2/spacemacs#L473-L476)
- [Arrow through the worksheets](https://github.com/ebanner/dotfiles/blob/deed94b024612ca1ed9c1e98f8e98ade793208a2/spacemacs#L479-L480) in a EIN notebook buffer (warning: [evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)-specific)
- Prevent jupyter from [popping open a new tab](https://github.com/ebanner/dotfiles/blob/deed94b024612ca1ed9c1e98f8e98ade793208a2/spacemacs#L496) in your web browser on startup

pynt is a tool that truly [stands on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants). Here are some projects where if they had not existed, then pynt would not have been possible.
