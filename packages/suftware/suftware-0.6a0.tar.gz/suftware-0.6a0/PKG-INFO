Description: SUFTware is a lightweight Python package that provides provides fast and robust implementations of Bayesian Field Theory (BFT) methods for low-dimensional statistical inference. BFT is a grid-based approach to Bayesian nonparametric inference. By using a grid in lieu of specific stochastic processes (such as Dirichlet processes or Gaussian processes), BFT allows certain types of problems to be solved in a fully Bayesian manner without requiring any large-data approximations.
        
        Currently, SUFTware supports a one-dimensional density estimation called DEFT. DEFT has substantial advantages over standard density estimation methods, including, including kernel density estimation and Dirichlet process mixture modeling. See [Chen et al., 2018; Kinney 2015; Kinney 2014].
