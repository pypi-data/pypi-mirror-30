        Running the demo projects
        -------------------------
        
        To get a first impression on **django-SHOP**, try out one of the six
        fully working demo projects.
        
        Run the demo in a local virtualenv
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Following the `introduction
        instructions <http://django-shop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/intro.html>`__
        should create a running shop in minutes, prefilled with a dozen of
        products. You can even pay by credit card, if you apply for your own
        testing account at Stripe.
        
        Run the demo using Docker
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A faster alternative to run one of the demos of **django-SHOP**, is to
        use a prepared Docker container available on the `Docker
        Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/awesto/django-shop-demo/>`__. If you have
        a running docker-machine, download and start the demo using:
        
        ::
        
            docker run --name demo-shop-i18n_polymorphic --env DJANGO_SHOP_TUTORIAL=i18n_polymorphic -p 9001:9001 awesto/django-shop-demo:latest
        
        Then point a browser on the IP address of your docker machine onto port
        9001. If unsure invoke ``docker-machine ip``. This for instance could be
        http://192.168.99.100:9001/ . To access the backend, sign in with
        username *admin* and password *secret*. The first invocation may take a
        few minutes, since additional assets have to be downloaded and the
        supplied images have to be thumbnailed.
        
        Current Status of Django-SHOP
        -----------------------------
        
        This version of django-SHOP is currently used to implement real
        e-commerce sites. If you want to get involved in the development, please
        have a look at our documentation in ``docs/contributing.rst``.
        
        **Django-SHOP** aims to be a the easy, fun and fast shop counterpart to
        **django-CMS**.
        
        Specifically, we aim at providing a clean, modular and
        Pythonic/Djangonic implementation of an e-commerce framework, that a
        moderately experienced Django developer should be able to pick up and
        run easily.
        
        Whenever possible, extra features shall be added to third party
        libraries. This implies that **django-SHOP** aims to provide an API,
        which allows merchants to add every feature they desire.
