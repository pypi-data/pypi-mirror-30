## What is it?
A command line tool to build and manage stacks of docker images. You can mix and match different sets of build instructions as a dependency graph to create maintainable and extensible stacks of docker images.


## Install it

Requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) and Python 2.7 or 3.5+.

```
pip install DockerMake 
```

This will install the command line tool, `docker-make`, and its supporting python package, which you can import as `import dockermake`. 


## Run it

To build some illustrative examples, try running the example in this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avirshup/DockerMake
cd DockerMake/example
docker-make --list
docker-make final
```


## What you can do with it

 * Define small pieces of configuration or functionality, then mix them together into production docker images.


#### Build automation
 * **new**: beta support for dockerfile build arguments
 * **new**: specify custom `.dockerignore` files for any given build step
 * Automated registry login and image pushes
 
#### File handling
 * Create builds that pull images from anywhere on your file system
 * Build your artifacts in a well-provisioned "build" images, then copy them into smaller images for deployment


#### Cache control
 - Invalidate docker's build cache at any point in the build (using `--bust-cache [layer]`)
 - **new**: Use specific images to [resolve docker's build cache](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/26065) (using `--cache-repo [repo]` and/or `--cache-tag [tag]`)
 - Force a clean rebuild without using the cache (using `--no-cache`)

 
## How to write DockerMake.yml
The idea is to write dockerfile commands for each specific piece of functionality in the `build` field, and "inherit" all other functionality from a list of other components that your image `requires`. If you need to add files with the ADD and COPY commands,  specify the root directory for those files with `build_directory`. Your tree of "requires" must have _exactly one_ unique named base image in the `FROM` field.

### Defining an image

The DockerMake.yml file is a YAML-formatted file. To create a basic image, you simply need to define its name, its base image, and a series of Dockerfile instructions, as follows:

```yaml
[first_image_name]:
  FROM: [named_base_image]
  build: |
    RUN [something]
    ADD [something else]
    [Dockerfile commands go here]
```

To re-use these build instructions in another image, list that image in the `requires` field:

```yaml
[another_image_name]:
   requires:
     - [first_image_name]
   build: |
     [additional Dockerfile instructions]
```

### Image definition fields
Image definitions can include any of the following fields:

* [**`FROM`/`FROM_DOCKERFILE`**](#fromfrom_dockerfile)
* [**`build`**](#build)
* [**`requires`**](#requires)
* [**`build_directory`**](#build_directory)
* [**`ignore`/`ignorefile`**](#ignoreignorefile)
* [**`description`**](#description)
* [**`copy_from`**](#copy_from)

#### **`FROM`/`FROM_DOCKERFILE`**
The docker image to use as a base for this image (and those that require it). This can be either the name of an image (using `FROM`) or the path to a local Dockerfile (using `FROM_DOCKERFILE`).

*Example:*
```yml
baseimage:
   FROM: python:3.6-slim
```
or
```yml
baseimage:
   FROM_DOCKERFILE: ../myproject/Dockerfile
   ```
#### **`build`**
Multi-line string defining dockerfile commands to build this step. Note that these commands CANNOT contain 'FROM'. See also [Notes on multi-line strings](#Notes) below.

*Example:*
```yml
build-image:
   requires:
     - baseimage
   build: |
     RUN apt-get update \
      && apt-get install -y gcc vi
     ENV editor=vi
```

#### **`requires`**
List of other image definitions to include in this one. `docker-make` will create a new image from a single DockerFile that includes an amalgamation of all image definitions.

*Example:*
 ```yml
 my-tools:
   build: |
     RUN pip install numpy jupyter pandas
     [...]

 data-sci-environment:
    requires:
      - baseimage
      - my-tools
 ```

#### **`build_directory`**
Path to a directory on your filesystem. This will be used to locate files for `ADD` and `COPY` commands in your dockerfile. See [Notes on relative paths](#Notes) below.

*Example:*
```yml
data-image:
    build_directory: ./datafiles
    build: |
      COPY data /opt/data
    [...]
```

#### **`ignore`/`ignorefile`**
A custom [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file) for this step. This overrides any existing `.dockerignore` file in the build context. Only relevant for `ADD` or `COPY` commands when the `build_directory` is specified. This can either be a multi-line string (using the `ignore` field)  or the path to a file (using the `ignorefile` field).

*Example:*
```yml
data-image:
    build_directory: ./datafiles
    build: |
      ADD [...]
    ignore: |
      *.pyc
      *~
      *.tmp
```
  
#### **`description`**
An arbitrary comment (ignored by `docker-make`)

#### **`copy_from`**
Used to copy files into this image _from other images_ (to copy from your filesystem or a URL, use the standard `ADD` and `COPY` dockerfile commands). This is a mapping of mappings of the form:
```yml
[image-name]:
   [...]
   copy_from:
     [source_image1]:
        [source path 1]: [dest path 1]
        [source path 2]: [dest path 2]
     [source image2]:
        [...]
```

Note that, for historical reasons, these copies are performed _after_ any _build_ instructions are executed.


 
 
### Notes

**Relative paths**: Several of these fields include paths on your local filesystem. They may be absolute or relative; _relative_ paths are resolved relative to the DockerMake.yml file they appear in. Use of `~` is allowed to denote the home directory.

**Multiline strings**: You'll usually want to express the `build` and `ignore` fields as multiline strings. To do so, use the following [YML "literal block scalar" style](http://yaml-multiline.info/) as follows;

```yml
field-name: |
  [line 1]
  [line 2]
  [...]
next field: [...]
```



## Example
[(See also this production example)](https://github.com/molecular-toolkit/chemistry-docker-images/tree/master/makefiles)

This example builds a single docker image called `data_science`. It does this by mixing together three components: `devbase` (the base image), `airline_data` (a big CSV file), and `python_image` (a python installation). `docker-make` will create an image that combines all of these components.

Here's the `DockerMake.yml` file:

```yaml
devbase:
 FROM: phusion/baseimage
 build: |
  RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get -y install 
      build-essential 
   && mkdir -p /opt

airline_data:
 build_directory: sample_data/airline_data
 build: |
  ADD AirPassengers.csv /data

plant_data:
 build_directory: sample_data/plant_growth
 build: |
  ADD Puromycin.csv /data

python_image:
 requires:
  - devbase
 build: |
  RUN apt-get install -y python python-pandas

data_science:
 requires:
  - python_image
  - airline_data
  - plant_data

```

To build an image called `alice/data_science`, you can run:
```bash
docker-make data_science --repository alice
```
which will create an image with all the commands in `python_image` and `airline_data`.

This works by dynamically generating a new Dockerfile every time you ask to build something. However, most of the commands will be cached, especially if you have a large hierarchy of base images. This actually leads to _less_ rebuilding than if you had a series of Dockerfiles linked together with `FROM` commands.

Here's the dependency graph and generated Dockerfiles:

                   [--debug]
                   [TARGETS [TARGETS ...]]

NOTE: Docker environmental variables must be set. For a docker-machine, run
`eval $(docker-machine env [machine-name])`

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Choosing what to build:
  TARGETS               Docker images to build as specified in the YAML file
  -f MAKEFILE, --makefile MAKEFILE
                        YAML file containing build instructions
  -a, --all             Print or build all images (or those specified by
                        _ALL_)
  -l, --list            List all available targets in the file, then exit.
  --build-arg BUILD_ARG
                        Set build-time variables (used the same way as docker
                        build --build-arg), e.g., `... --build-arg VAR1=val1
                        --build-arg VAR2=val2`
  --requires [REQUIRES [REQUIRES ...]]
                        Build a special image from these requirements.
                        Requires --name
  --name NAME           Name for custom docker images (requires --requires)

Dockerfiles:
  -p, --print-dockerfiles, --print_dockerfiles
                        Print out the generated dockerfiles named
                        `Dockerfile.[image]`
  -n, --no_build        Only print Dockerfiles, don't build them. Implies
                        --print.
  --dockerfile-dir DOCKERFILE_DIR
                        Directory to save dockerfiles in (default:
                        ./docker_makefiles)

Image caching:
  --pull                Always try to pull updated FROM images
  --cache-repo CACHE_REPO
                        Repository to use for cached images. This allows you
                        to invoke the `docker build --build-from` option for
                        each image.For instance, running `docker-make foo bar
                        --cache-repo docker.io/cache` will use
                        docker.io/cache/foo as a cache for `foo` and
                        docker.io/cache/bar as a cachefor `bar`.
  --cache-tag CACHE_TAG
                        Tag to use for cached images; can be used with the
                        --cache-repo option (see above).
  --no-cache            Rebuild every layer
  --bust-cache BUST_CACHE
                        Force docker to rebuilt all layers in this image. You
                        can bust multiple image layers by passing --bust-cache
                        multiple times.
  --clear-copy-cache, --clear-cache
                        Remove docker-make's cache of files for `copy-from`.
  --keep-build-tags     Don't untag intermediate build containers when build
                        is complete

Repositories and tags:
  --repository REPOSITORY, -r REPOSITORY, -u REPOSITORY
                        Prepend this repository to all built images, e.g.
                        `docker-make hello-world -u quay.io/elvis` will tag
                        the image as `quay.io/elvis/hello-world`. You can add
                        a ':' to the end to image names into tags: `docker-
                        make -u quay.io/elvis/repo: hello-world` will create
                        the image in the elvis repository:
                        quay.io/elvis/repo:hello-world
  --tag TAG, -t TAG     Tag all built images with this tag. If image names are
                        ALREADY tags (i.e., your repo name ends in a ":"),
                        this will append the tag name with a dash. For
                        example: `docker-make hello-world -u elvis/repo: -t
                        1.0` will create the image "elvis/repo:hello-world-1.0
  --push-to-registry, -P
                        Push all built images to the repository specified
                        (only if image repository contains a URL) -- to push
                        to dockerhub.com, use index.docker.io as the registry)
  --registry-user REGISTRY_USER, --user REGISTRY_USER
                        For pushes: log into the registry using this username
  --registry-token REGISTRY_TOKEN, --token REGISTRY_TOKEN
                        Token or password to log into registry (optional; uses
                        $HOME/.dockercfg or $HOME/.docker/config.json if not
                        passed)

Help:
  --version             Print version and exit.
  --help-yaml           Print summary of YAML file format and exit.
  --debug
