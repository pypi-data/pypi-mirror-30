brain_diffusion
========
Brain_diffusion is a tool for calculating and analyzing MSDs from trajectory
datasets.

It can calculate MSDs from input trajectories, perform averaging over large
datasets, and visualization tools.  It also provides templates for parallel
computing.

To get started using these components in your own software, please go to the
repository README_.
