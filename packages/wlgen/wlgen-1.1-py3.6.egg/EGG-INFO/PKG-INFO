Description: A recursive wordlist generator written in Python.
        For each string position, custom character sets can be defined.
        Currently there are two implementations to generate a wordlist.
        gen_wordlist builds the whole list in memory before writing it,
        gen_words is a generator that is memory efficient but slower.
