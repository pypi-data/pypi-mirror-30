        Inter Credit Optimal Allocation Prediction (optialtion).
        It is a python package to Inter-credit. Design for an algorithm embedded in an online collection system.
        
        Introduction
        --------------
        
        
        Optiation is a modeling and data processing process module, which includes several methods and methods of model training and evaluation. At present, it is deployed on the joint trust collection system, and is negative to supervise the prediction of learning. The bottom of the model calls some third party modules, including sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm and so on. There are also some numerical libraries, including numpy, pandas and so on. Optiation uses an object-oriented programming idea, and the module has a class pylog that handles logs, which can print the python script log on the command line and save it in the log file. More content, please install the experience.
