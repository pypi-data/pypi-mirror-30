**Configuration Options**
---

1. Firewall

    + Enable Firewall?
    	- This helps protect your Mac from being attacked over the internet by viruses and worms.
    + Enable Logging?
    	- If there is an infection, logs are helpful for determining the source.
    + Enable Stealth Mode?
    	- If enabled, your Mac will not respond to network discovery attempts with ICMP ping requests, and will not answer connection attempts made from closed TCP and UDP networks.

2. System Protection

    + Enable Gatekeeper?
    	- Protect against malware by enforcing code signing and verifying downloaded applications before letting them to run.
    + Prevent automatic software whitelisting?
    + Disable Captive Portal Assistant and force login through browser on untrusted networks?
    	- On an untrusted network, Captive Portal could be triggered and direct you to a malicious site WITHOUT any user interaction.

3. User Metadata Storage

    + Clear language modeling data?
    	- This includes user spelling and suggestion data.
    + Disable language modeling data collection?
    + Clear QuickLook metadata?
    + Clear Downloads metadata?
    + Disable metadata collection from Downloads?
    + Clear SiriAnalytics database?

4. User Safety

    + Lock Mac as soon as screen saver starts?
    + Display all file extensions?
    	- This prevents malware from disguising itself as another file type.
    + Disable saving documents to the cloud by default?
    + Show hidden files in Finder?
    	- This lets you see all files on the system without having to use the terminal.
