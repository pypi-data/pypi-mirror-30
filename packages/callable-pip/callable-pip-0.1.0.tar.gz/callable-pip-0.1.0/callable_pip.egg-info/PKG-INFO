        ============
        
        ``callable-pip`` patches over the wide use of ``pip.main()``
        
        ``pip.main()`` has never been a publicly supported API for ``pip``, but it has
        often been used as such.
        
        ``callable-pip`` provides two public methods:
        
        A drop-in replacement for ``pip.main()``::
        
            import callable_pip
            callable_pip.main()
        
        A patch which adds ``pip.main()`` back to ``pip``, but which is dangerous and
        known not to work on versions of ``pip`` which are not importable::
        
            import callable_pip
            callable_pip.dangerous_patch()
            ...
            pip.main()  # actually invokes callable_pip.main()
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        If you are writing a python program, you can just use ``callable_pip.main()``
        yourself.
        
        If you have dependencies which use ``pip.main``, you can call
        ``callable_pip.dangerous_patch()`` yourself and it will usually work.
        
        ``dangerous_patch`` is so-named because it is *not* guaranteed to work on all
        ``pip`` versions and it is dangerous. Avoid it when possible.
        
        Patching Without Control of Source
        ----------------------------------
        
        You may be a consumer of packages which use ``pip.main()`` in a context where
        you cannot modify or do not own the source. These techniques may help you.
        
        More details on ``sitecustomize.py`` and ``.pth`` files can be found in the
        Python documentation:
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html
        
        Remember to remove these patches if you uninstall ``callable_pip``, or Python
        will fail to start.
        
        Applying the Patch With sitecustomize.py
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``sitecustomize.py`` is a file which is automatically loaded by the python
        interpreter. It can exist anywhere in the ``PYTHONPATH``, including the current
        directory.
        
        Add a ``sitecustomize.py`` with the following content, or append it to an
        existing ``sitecustomize.py``::
        
            import callable_pip
            callable_pip.dangerous_patch()
        
        Applying the Patch With a .pth File
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The ``.pth`` file can have any name you want, but must be installed in the
        ``site-packages`` directory.
        
        Add a file, e.g. ``callable_pip.pth``, with the following content::
        
            import callable_pip; callable_pip.dangerous_patch()
